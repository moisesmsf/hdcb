## Audit
Run the following command to verify **/etc/gshadow** is mode 640 or more restrictive, **Uid** is **0/root** and **Gid** is **0/root**:
```bash
# stat -Lc 'Access: (%#a/%A) Uid: ( %u/ %U) Gid: ( %g/ %G)' /etc/gshadow
```

Example:
```bash
Access: (0640/-rw-r-----) Uid: ( 0/ root) Gid: ( 42/ shadow)
```

## Remediation
Run **one** of the following commands to set ownership of **/etc/gshadow** to **root** and group to either **root** or **shadow**:
```bash
# chown root:shadow /etc/gshadow
-OR-
# chown root:root /etc/gshadow
```

Run the following command to remove excess permissions form **/etc/gshadow**:
```bash
# chmod u-x,g-wx,o-rwx /etc/gshadow
```

**Default Value**:
Access: (0640/-rw-r-----) Uid: ( 0/ root) Gid: ( 42/ shadow)
