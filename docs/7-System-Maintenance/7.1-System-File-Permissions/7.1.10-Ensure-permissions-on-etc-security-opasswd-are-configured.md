## Audit
Run the following commands to verify **/etc/security/opasswd** and **/etc/security/opasswd.old** are mode 600 or more restrictive, **Uid** is **0/root** and **Gid** is **0/root** if they exist:
```bash
# [ -e "/etc/security/opasswd" ] && stat -Lc '%n Access: (%#a/%A) Uid: (%u/ %U) Gid: ( %g/ %G)' /etc/security/opasswd

/etc/security/opasswd Access: (0600/-rw-------) Uid: ( 0/ root) Gid: ( 0/root)
-OR-
Nothing is returned
# [ -e "/etc/security/opasswd.old" ] && stat -Lc '%n Access: (%#a/%A) Uid: ( %u/ %U) Gid: ( %g/ %G)' /etc/security/opasswd.old

/etc/security/opasswd.old Access: (0600/-rw-------) Uid: ( 0/ root) Gid: (0/ root)
-OR-
Nothing is returned
```

```bash
# [ -e "/etc/security/opasswd" ] && chmod u-x,go-rwx /etc/security/opasswd
# [ -e "/etc/security/opasswd" ] && chown root:root /etc/security/opasswd
# [ -e "/etc/security/opasswd.old" ] && chmod u-x,go-rwx /etc/security/opasswd.old
# [ -e "/etc/security/opasswd.old" ] && chown root:root /etc/security/opasswd.old
