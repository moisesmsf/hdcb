## Audit
Run the following command to verify **/etc/shells** is mode 640 or more restrictive, **Uid** is **0/root** and **Gid** is **0/root**:
```bash
# stat -Lc 'Access: (%#a/%A) Uid: ( %u/ %U) Gid: ( %g/ %G)' /etc/shells
Access: (0644/-rw-r--r--) Uid: ( 0/ root) Gid: ( 0/ root)
```

## Remediation
Run the following commands to remove excess permissions, set owner, and set group on **/etc/shells**:
```bash
# chmod u-x,go-wx /etc/shells
# chown root:root /etc/shells
```

**Default Value**:
Access: (0644/-rw-r--r--) Uid: ( 0/ root) Gid: ( 0/ root)
