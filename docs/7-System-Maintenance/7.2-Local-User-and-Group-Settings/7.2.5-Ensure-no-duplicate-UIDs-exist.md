title: 7.2.5 Ensure no duplicate UIDs exist
description: Although the useradd program will not let you create a duplicate User ID (UID), it is possible for an administrator to manually edit the /etc/passwd file and change the UID field.

## Audit
Run the following script and verify no results are returned:
```bash linenums="1"
#!/usr/bin/env bash
{
while read -r l_count l_uid; do
if [ "$l_count" -gt 1 ]; then
echo -e "Duplicate UID: \"$l_uid\" Users: \"$(awk -F: '($3 == n) { print $1 }' n=$l_uid /etc/passwd | xargs)\""
fi
done < <(cut -f3 -d":" /etc/passwd | sort -n | uniq -c)
}
```

## Remediation
Based on the results of the audit script, establish unique UIDs and review all files owned by the shared UIDs to determine which UID they are supposed to belong to.
