## Audit
Run the following script and verify no results are returned:
```bash linenums="1"
#!/usr/bin/env bash
{
while read -r l_count l_user; do
if [ "$l_count" -gt 1 ]; then
echo -e "Duplicate User: \"$l_user\" Users: \"$(awk -F: '($1 == n) { print $1 }' n=$l_user /etc/passwd | xargs)\""
fi
done < <(cut -f1 -d":" /etc/group | sort -n | uniq -c)
}
```

## Remediation
Based on the results of the audit script, establish unique user names for the users. File ownerships will automatically reflect the change as long as the users have unique UIDs.
