description: Although the groupadd program will not let you create a duplicate Group ID (GID), it is possible for an administrator to manually edit the /etc/group file and change the GID field.

## Audit
Run the following script and verify no results are returned:
```bash linenums="1"
#!/usr/bin/env bash
{
while read -r l_count l_gid; do
if [ "$l_count" -gt 1 ]; then
echo -e "Duplicate GID: \"$l_gid\" Groups: \"$(awk -F: '($3 == n) { print $1 }' n=$l_gid /etc/group | xargs)\""
fi
done < <(cut -f3 -d":" /etc/group | sort -n | uniq -c)
}
```

## Remediation
Based on the results of the audit script, establish unique GIDs and review all files owned by the shared GID to determine which group they are supposed to belong to.
