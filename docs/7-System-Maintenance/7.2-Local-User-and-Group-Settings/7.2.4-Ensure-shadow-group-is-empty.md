## Audit
Run the following commands and verify no results are returned:
```bash
# awk -F: '($1=="shadow") {print $NF}' /etc/group
# awk -F: '($4 == '"$(getent group shadow | awk -F: '{print $3}' | xargs)"') {print " - user: \"" $1 "\" primary group is the shadow group"}' /etc/passwd
```

## Remediation
Run the following command to remove all users from the shadow group
```bash
# sed -ri 's/(^shadow:[^:]*:[^:]*:)([^:]+$)/\1/' /etc/group
```

Change the primary group of any users with shadow as their primary group.
```bash
# usermod -g <primary group> <user>
```
