## Audit
Run the following command and verify that no output is returned:
```bash
# awk -F: '($2 == "" ) { print $1 " does not have a password "}' /etc/shadow
```

## Remediation
If any accounts in the /etc/shadow file do not have a password, run the following command to lock the account until it can be determined why it does not have a
password:
```bash
# passwd -l <username>
```

Also, check to see if the account is logged in and investigate what it is being used for to determine if it needs to be forced off.
