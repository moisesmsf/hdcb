## Audit
Run the following command:
```bash
# find /boot -type f -name 'grub.cfg' -exec grep -Ph -- '^\h*linux' {} + | grep -v 'audit=1'
```

Nothing should be returned.

## Remediation
Edit **/etc/default/grub** and add **audit=1** to **GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX**:
Example:
```bash
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="audit=1"
```

Run the following command to update the **grub2** configuration:
```bash
# update-grub
```
