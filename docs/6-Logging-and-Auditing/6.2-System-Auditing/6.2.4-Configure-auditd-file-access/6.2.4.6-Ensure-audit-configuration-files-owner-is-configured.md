## Audit
Run the following command to verify that the audit configuration files are owned by the root user:
```bash
# find /etc/audit/ -type f \( -name '*.conf' -o -name '*.rules' \) ! -user root
```
Nothing should be returned

## Remediation
Run the following command to change ownership to **root** user:
```bash
# find /etc/audit/ -type f \( -name '*.conf' -o -name '*.rules' \) ! -user root -exec chown root {} +
```
