## Audit
Run the following command to verify the audit tools are owned by the group **root**
```bash
# stat -Lc "%n %G" /sbin/auditctl /sbin/aureport /sbin/ausearch /sbin/autrace /sbin/auditd /sbin/augenrules | awk '$2 != "root" {print}'
```
Nothing should be returned

## Remediation
Run the following command to change group ownership to the groop **root**:
```bash
# chgrp root /sbin/auditctl /sbin/aureport /sbin/ausearch /sbin/autrace /sbin/auditd /sbin/augenrules
```
