## Audit
Run the following command to verify the audit tools are owned by the **root** user:
```bash
# stat -Lc "%n %U" /sbin/auditctl /sbin/aureport /sbin/ausearch /sbin/autrace /sbin/auditd /sbin/augenrules | awk '$2 != "root" {print}'
```
Nothing should be returned

## Remediation
Run the following command to change the owner of the audit tools to the **root** user:
```bash
# chown root /sbin/auditctl /sbin/aureport /sbin/ausearch /sbin/autrace /sbin/auditd /sbin/augenrules
```
