## Audit
Run the following command to verify that the audit configuration files are owned by the group **root**:
```bash
# find /etc/audit/ -type f \( -name '*.conf' -o -name '*.rules' \) ! -group root
```
Nothing should be returned

## Remediation
Run the following command to change group to **root**:
```bash
# find /etc/audit/ -type f \( -name '*.conf' -o -name '*.rules' \) ! -group root -exec chgrp root {} +
```
