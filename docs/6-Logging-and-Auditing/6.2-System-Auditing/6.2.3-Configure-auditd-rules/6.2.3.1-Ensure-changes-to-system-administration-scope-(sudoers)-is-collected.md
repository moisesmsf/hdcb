title: 6.2.3.1 Ensure changes to system administration scope (sudoers) is collected
description: Monitor scope changes for system administrators. If the system has been properly configured to force system administrators to log in as themselves first and then use the sudo command to execute privileged commands, it is possible to monitor changes in scope. The file /etc/sudoers, or files in /etc/sudoers.d, will be written to when the file(s) or related attributes have changed. The audit records will be tagged with the identifier "scope".

## Audit
**On disk configuration**
Run the following command to check the on disk rules:
```bash
# awk '/^ *-w/ \
&&/\/etc\/sudoers/ \
&&/ +-p *wa/ \
&&(/ key= *[!-~]* *$/||/ -k *[!-~]* *$/)' /etc/audit/rules.d/*.rules
```

Verify the output matches:
```bash
-w /etc/sudoers -p wa -k scope
-w /etc/sudoers.d -p wa -k scope
```

**Running configuration**
Run the following command to check loaded rules:
```bash
# auditctl -l | awk '/^ *-w/ \
&&/\/etc\/sudoers/ \
&&/ +-p *wa/ \
&&(/ key= *[!-~]* *$/||/ -k *[!-~]* *$/)'
```

Verify the output matches:
```bash
-w /etc/sudoers -p wa -k scope
-w /etc/sudoers.d -p wa -k scope
```

## Remediation
Edit or create a file in the **/etc/audit/rules.d/** directory, ending in **.rules** extension, with the relevant rules to monitor scope changes for system administrators.
Example:
```bash
# printf "
-w /etc/sudoers -p wa -k scope
-w /etc/sudoers.d -p wa -k scope
" >> /etc/audit/rules.d/50-scope.rules
```

Merge and load the rules into active configuration:
```bash
# augenrules --load
```

Check if reboot is required.
```bash
# if [[ $(auditctl -s | grep "enabled") =~ "2" ]]; then printf "Reboot required to load rules\n"; fi
```
