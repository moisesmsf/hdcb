## Audit
Run the following command and verify output matches:
```bash
# grep -Ph -- '^\h*-e\h+2\b' /etc/audit/rules.d/*.rules | tail -1
-e 2
```

## Remediation
Edit or create the file **/etc/audit/rules.d/99-finalize.rules** and add the line **-e 2** at the end of the file:

Example:
```bash
# printf '\n%s' "-e 2" >> /etc/audit/rules.d/99-finalize.rules
```

**Load audit rules**
Merge and load the rules into active configuration:
```bash
# augenrules --load
```

Check if reboot is required.
```bash
# if [[ $(auditctl -s | grep "enabled") =~ "2" ]]; then printf "Reboot required to load rules\n"; fi
```
