## Audit
Run the following script to analyze the **logrotate** configuration:
```bash linenums="1"
#!/usr/bin/env bash
{
l_analyze_cmd="$(readlink -f /bin/systemd-analyze)"
l_config_file="/etc/logrotate.conf"
l_include="$(awk '$1~/^\s*include$/{print$2}' "$l_config_file" 2>/dev/null)"
[ -d "$l_include" ] && l_include="$l_include/*"
$l_analyze_cmd cat-config "$l_config_file" $l_include
}
```

**Note**: The last occurrence of a argument is the one used for the **logrotate** configuration

## Remediation
Edit **/etc/logrotate.conf**, or the appropriate configuration file provided by the script in the Audit Procedure, as necessary to ensure logs are rotated according to site policy.
