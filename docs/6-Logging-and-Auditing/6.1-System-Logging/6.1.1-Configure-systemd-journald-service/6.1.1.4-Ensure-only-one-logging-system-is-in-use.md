## Audit
Run the following script to ensure only one logging system is in use:
```bash linenums="1"
#!/usr/bin/env bash
{
l_output="" l_output2="" # Check the status of rsyslog and journald
if systemctl is-active --quiet rsyslog; then
l_output="$l_output\n - rsyslog is in use\n- follow the recommendations in Configure rsyslog subsection only"
elif systemctl is-active --quiet systemd-journald; then
l_output="$l_output\n - journald is in use\n- follow the recommendations in Configure journald subsection only"
else
echo -e “unable to determine system logging”
l_output2="$l_output2\n - unable to determine system logging\n-Configure only ONE system logging: rsyslog OR journald"
fi
if [ -z "$l_output2" ]; then # Provide audit results
echo -e "\n- Audit Result:\n ** PASS **\n$l_output\n"
else
echo -e "\n- Audit Result:\n ** FAIL **\n - Reason(s) for audit failure:\n$l_output2"
fi
}
```

## Remediation
1. Determine whether to use **journald - OR - rsyslog** depending on site needs
2. Configure **systemd-jounald.service**
3. Configure only **ONE** either **journald - OR - rsyslog** and complete the recommendations in that subsection
4. Return to this recommendation to ensure only one logging system is in use
