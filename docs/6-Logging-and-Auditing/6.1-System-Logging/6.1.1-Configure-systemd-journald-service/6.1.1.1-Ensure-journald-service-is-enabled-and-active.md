## Audit
Run the following command to verify **systemd-journald** is enabled:
```bash
# systemctl is-enabled systemd-journald.service
static
```

**Note**: By default the **systemd-journald** service does not have an **[Install]** section and thus cannot be enabled / disabled. It is meant to be referenced as **Requires** or **Wants** by other unit files. As such, if the status of **systemd-journald** is not **static**, investigate why

Run the following command to verify **systemd-journald** is active:
```bash
# systemctl is-active systemd-journald.service
active
```

## Remediation
Run the following commands to unmask and start **systemd-journald.service**
```bash
# systemctl unmask systemd-journald.service
# systemctl start systemd-journald.service
```
