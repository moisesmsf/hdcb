## Audit
Run the following command and verify loopback interface to accept traffic:
```bash
# grep -P -- 'lo|127.0.0.0' /etc/ufw/before.rules
```

Output includes:
```bash
# allow all on loopback
-A ufw-before-input -i lo -j ACCEPT
-A ufw-before-output -o lo -j ACCEPT
```

Run the following command and verify all other interfaces deny traffic to the loopback network (127.0.0.0/8 for IPv4 and ::1/128 for IPv6)
```bash
# ufw status verbose
To			Action		From
--			------		----
Anywhere		DENY IN		127.0.0.0/8
Anywhere (v6)		DENY IN		::1
```

**Note**: **ufw status** only shows rules added with **ufw** and not the rules found in the **/etc/ufw** rules files where allow all on loopback is configured by default.

## Remediation
Run the following commands to configure the loopback interface to accept traffic:
```bash
# ufw allow in on lo
# ufw allow out on lo
```

Run the following commands to configure all other interfaces to deny traffic to the loopback network:
```bash
# ufw deny in from 127.0.0.0/8
# ufw deny in from ::1
```

**Default Value**:
```bash
# allow all on loopback
-A ufw-before-input -i lo -j ACCEPT
-A ufw-before-output -o lo -j ACCEPT
```
