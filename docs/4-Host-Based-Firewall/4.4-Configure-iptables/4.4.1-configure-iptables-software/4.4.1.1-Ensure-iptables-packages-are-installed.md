title: 4.4.1.1 Ensure iptables packages are installed
description: iptables is a utility program that allows a system administrator to configure the tables provided by the Linux kernel firewall, implemented as different Netfilter modules, and the chains and rules it stores. Different kernel modules and programs are used for different protocols; iptables applies to IPv4, ip6tables to IPv6, arptables to ARP, and ebtables to Ethernet frames.
