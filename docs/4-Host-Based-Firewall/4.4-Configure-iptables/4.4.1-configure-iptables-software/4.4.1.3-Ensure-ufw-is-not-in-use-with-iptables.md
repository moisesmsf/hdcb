## Audit
Run the following commands to verify that **ufw** is **either** not installed or disabled. **Only one of the following needs to pass**.

Run the following command to verify that **ufw** is not installed:
```bash
# dpkg-query -s ufw &>/dev/null && echo "ufw is installed"
```
Nothing should be returned.

**- OR -**
Run the following command to verify ufw is disabled:
```bash
# ufw status
Status: inactive
```

Run the following commands to verify that the **ufw.service** is not enabled:
```bash
# systemctl is-enabled ufw 2>dev/null | grep '^enabled'
```
Nothing should be returned

Run the following command to verify **ufw.service** is not active:
```bash
# systemctl is-active ufw.service 2>/dev/null | grep '^active'
```
Nothing should be returned

## Remediation
Run the following command to remove ufw:
```bash
# apt purge ufw
```

**- OR -**
Run the following commands to disable ufw, and stop and mask **ufw.service**:
```bash
# ufw disable
# systemctl stop ufw.service
# systemctl mask ufw.service
```
**Note**: **ufw disable** needs to be run before **systemctl mask ufw.service** in order to correctly disable **UFW**
