## Audit
Run the following command and verify all rules for new outbound, and established connections match site policy:
```bash
# iptables -L -v -n
```

## Remediation
Configure iptables in accordance with site policy. The following commands will implement a policy to allow all outbound connections and all established connections:
```bash
# iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
# iptables -A OUTPUT -p udp -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
# iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m state --state ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
# iptables -A INPUT -p udp -m state --state ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
```
