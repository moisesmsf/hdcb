## Audit
Run the following command to determine open ports:
```bash
# ss -4tuln
Netid State Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address:Port Peer Address:Port
udp UNCONN 0 0 *:68 *:*
udp UNCONN 0 0 *:123 *:*
tcp LISTEN 0 128 *:22 *:*
```

Run the following command to determine firewall rules:
```bash
# iptables -L INPUT -v -n
Chain INPUT (policy DROP 0 packets, 0 bytes)
pkts bytes target prot opt in out source destination
 0 0 ACCEPT all -- lo * 0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0
 0 0 DROP all -- * * 127.0.0.0/8 0.0.0.0/0
 0 0 ACCEPT tcp -- * * 0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0
tcp dpt:22 state NEW
```

Verify all open ports listening on non-localhost addresses have at least one firewall rule. The last line identified by the **tcp dpt:22 state NEW** identifies it as a firewall rule for new connections on tcp port 22.

## Remediation
For each port identified in the audit which does not have a firewall rule establish a proper rule for accepting inbound connections:
```bash
# iptables -A INPUT -p <protocol> --dport <port> -m state --state NEW -j ACCEPT
```
