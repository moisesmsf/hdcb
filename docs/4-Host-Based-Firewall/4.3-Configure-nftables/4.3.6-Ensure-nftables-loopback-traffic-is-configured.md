## Audit
Run the following commands to verify that the loopback interface is configured:
Run the following command to verify the loopback interface is configured to accept
network traffic:
```bash
# nft list ruleset | awk '/hook input/,/}/' | grep 'iif "lo" accept'
```

Example output:
```bash
iif "lo" accept
```

Run the following command to verify network traffic from an iPv4 loopback interface is configured to drop:
```bash
# nft list ruleset | awk '/hook input/,/}/' | grep 'ip saddr'
```

Example output:
```bash
ip saddr 127.0.0.0/8 counter packets 0 bytes 0 drop
```

**- IF -** IPv6 is enabled on the system:
Run the following command to verify that the IPv6 loopback interface is configured to drop:
```bash
# nft list ruleset | awk '/hook input/,/}/' | grep 'ip6 saddr'
```

Example output:
```bash
ip6 saddr ::1 counter packets 0 bytes 0 drop
```

## Remediation
Run the following commands to implement the loopback rules:
```bash
# nft add rule inet filter input iif lo accept
# nft create rule inet filter input ip saddr 127.0.0.0/8 counter drop
```

**- IF -** IPv6 is enabled on the system:
Run the following command to implement the IPv6 loopback rule:
```bash
# nft add rule inet filter input ip6 saddr ::1 counter drop
```
