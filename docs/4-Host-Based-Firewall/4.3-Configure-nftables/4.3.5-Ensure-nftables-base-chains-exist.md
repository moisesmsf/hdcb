title: 4.3.5 Ensure nftables base chains exist
description: Chains are containers for rules. They exist in two kinds, base chains and regular chains. A base chain is an entry point for packets from the networking stack, a regular chain may be used as jump target and is used for better rule organization.

## Audit
Run the following commands and verify that base chains exist for INPUT.
```bash
# nft list ruleset | grep 'hook input'
type filter hook input priority 0;
```

Run the following commands and verify that base chains exist for FORWARD.
```bash
# nft list ruleset | grep 'hook forward'
type filter hook forward priority 0;
```

Run the following commands and verify that base chains exist for OUTPUT.
```bash
# nft list ruleset | grep 'hook output'
type filter hook output priority 0;
```

## Remediation
Run the following command to create the base chains:
```bash
# nft create chain inet <table name> <base chain name> { type filter hook <(input|forward|output)> priority 0 \; }
```

Example:
```bash
# nft create chain inet filter input { type filter hook input priority 0 \; }
# nft create chain inet filter forward { type filter hook forward priority 0 \; }
# nft create chain inet filter output { type filter hook output priority 0 \; }
```
