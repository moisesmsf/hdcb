```bash
# dpkg-query -s ufw &>/dev/null && echo "ufw is installed"
```
Nothing should be returned
**-OR-**
Run the following commands to verify ufw is disabled and ufw.service is not enabled:
```bash
# ufw status
Status: inactive
# systemctl is-enabled ufw.service
masked
```

## Remediation
Run **one** of the following commands to either remove **ufw** or disable **ufw.service**

Run the following command to remove **ufw**:
```bash
# apt purge ufw
```
**-OR-**
Run the following commands to disable **ufw** and mask **ufw.service**:
