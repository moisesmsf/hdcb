title: 4.3.10 Ensure nftables rules are permanent
description: nftables is a subsystem of the Linux kernel providing filtering and classification of network packets/datagrams/frames. The nftables service reads the /etc/nftables.conf file for a nftables file or files to include in the nftables ruleset. A nftables ruleset containing the input, forward, and output base chains allow network traffic to be filtered.

## Audit
Run the following commands to verify that input, forward, and output base chains are configured to be applied to a nftables ruleset on boot:
Run the following command to verify the input base chain:
```bash
# [ -n "$(grep -E '^\s*include' /etc/nftables.conf)" ] && awk '/hook input/,/}/' $(awk '$1 ~ /^\s*include/ { gsub("\"","",$2);print $2 }' /etc/nftables.conf)
```

Output should be similar to:
```bash
type filter hook input priority 0; policy drop;
 
# Ensure loopback traffic is configured
iif "lo" accept
ip saddr 127.0.0.0/8 counter packets 0 bytes 0 drop
ip6 saddr ::1 counter packets 0 bytes 0 drop

# Ensure established connections are configured
ip protocol tcp ct state established accept
ip protocol udp ct state established accept

# Accept port 22(SSH) traffic from anywhere
tcp dport ssh accept
```

Review the input base chain to ensure that it follows local site policy

Run the following command to verify the forward base chain:
```bash
# [ -n "$(grep -E '^\s*include' /etc/nftables.conf)" ] && awk '/hook forward/,/}/' $(awk '$1 ~ /^\s*include/ { gsub("\"","",$2);print $2 }' /etc/nftables.conf)
```

Output should be similar to:
```bash
 # Base chain for hook forward named forward (Filters forwarded network packets)
 chain forward {
 	type filter hook forward priority 0; policy drop;
 }
```

Review the forward base chain to ensure that it follows local site policy.

Run the following command to verify the forward base chain:
```bash
# [ -n "$(grep -E '^\s*include' /etc/nftables.conf)" ] && awk '/hook output/,/}/' $(awk '$1 ~ /^\s*include/ { gsub("\"","",$2);print $2 }' /etc/nftables.conf)
```

Output should be similar to:
```bash
 # Base chain for hook output named output (Filters outbound network packets)
 chain output {
 	type filter hook output priority 0; policy drop;
 
	 # Ensure outbound and established connections are configured
	 ip protocol tcp ct state established,related,new accept
	 ip protocol udp ct state established,related,new accept
 }
```

Review the output base chain to ensure that it follows local site policy.

## Remediation
Edit the **/etc/nftables.conf** file and un-comment or add a line with `include <Absolute path to nftables rules file>` for each nftables file you want included in the nftables ruleset on boot

Example:
```bash
# vi /etc/nftables.conf
```

Add the line:
```bash
include "/etc/nftables.rules"
```
