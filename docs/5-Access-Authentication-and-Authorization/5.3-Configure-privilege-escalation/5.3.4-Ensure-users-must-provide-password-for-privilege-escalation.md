## Audit
**Note**: If passwords are not being used for authentication, this is not applicable.

Verify the operating system requires users to supply a password for privilege escalation. Check the configuration of the /etc/sudoers and /etc/sudoers.d/* files with the following command:
```bash
# grep -r "^[^#].*NOPASSWD" /etc/sudoers*
```

If any line is found refer to the remediation procedure below.

## Remediation
Based on the outcome of the audit procedure, use visudo -f ``<PATH TO FILE>`` to edit the relevant sudoers file.

Remove any line with occurrences of NOPASSWD tags in the file.
