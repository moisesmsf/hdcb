## Audit
Run the following command to verify PermitUserEnviroment is set to **no**:
```bash
# sshd -T | grep permituserenvironment
permituserenvironment no
```

## Remediation
Edit the **/etc/ssh/sshd_config** file to set the **PermitUserEnvironment** parameter to **no** above any **Include** entries as follows:
```bash
PermitUserEnvironment no
```
**Note**: First occurrence of a option takes precedence. If **Include** locations are enabled, used, and order of precedence is understood in your environment, the entry may be created in a file in **Include** location.

**Default Value:**
PermitUserEnvironment no
