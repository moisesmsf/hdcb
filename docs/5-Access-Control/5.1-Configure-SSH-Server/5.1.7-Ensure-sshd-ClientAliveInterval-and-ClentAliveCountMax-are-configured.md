title: 5.1.7 Ensure sshd ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax are configured
description: To clarify, the two settings described below are only meant for idle connections from a protocol perspective and are not meant to check if the user is active or not. An idle user does not mean an idle connection. SSH does not and never had, intentionally, the capability to drop idle users. In SSH versions before 8.2p1 there was a bug that caused these values to behave in such a manner that they were abused to disconnect idle users. This bug has been resolved in 8.2p1 and thus it can no longer be abused disconnect idle users.

## Audit
Run the following command and verify **ClientAliveInterval** and **ClientAliveCountMax** are greater than zero:
```bash
# sshd -T | grep -Pi -- '(clientaliveinterval|clientalivecountmax)'
```

Example output:
```bash
clientaliveinterval 15
clientalivecountmax 3
```

**- IF -** **Match** set statements are used in your environment, specify the connection parameters to use for the **-T** extended test mode and run the audit to verify the setting is not incorrectly configured in a match block
Example additional audit needed for a match block for the user **sshuser**:
```bash
# sshd -T -C user=sshuser | grep -Pi -- '(clientaliveinterval|clientalivecountmax)'
```

**Note**: If provided, any Match directives in the configuration file that would apply are applied before the configuration is written to standard output. The connection parameters are supplied as keyword=value pairs and may be supplied in any order, either with multiple **-C** options or as a comma-separated list. The keywords are **addr** (source address), **user** (user), **host** (resolved source host name), **laddr** (local address), **lport** (local port number), and **rdomain** (routing domain).

## Remediation
Edit the **/etc/ssh/sshd_config** file to set the **ClientAliveInterval** and **ClientAliveCountMax** parameters above any **Include** and **Match** entries according to site policy.

Example:
```bash
ClientAliveInterval 15
ClientAliveCountMax 3
```

**Note**: First occurrence of a option takes precedence, Match set statements withstanding. If Include locations are enabled, used, and order of precedence is understood in your environment, the entry may be created in a file in Include location.

**Default Value:**
ClientAliveInterval 0
ClientAliveCountMax 3
