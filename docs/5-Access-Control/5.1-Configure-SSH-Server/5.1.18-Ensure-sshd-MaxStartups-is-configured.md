## Audit
Run the following command to verify **MaxStartups** is **10:30:60** or more restrictive:
```bash
# sshd -T | awk '$1 ~ /^\s*maxstartups/{split($2, a, ":");{if(a[1] > 10 || a[2] > 30 || a[3] > 60) print $0}}'
```
Nothing should be returned.

## Remediation
Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to set the MaxStartups parameter to 10:30:60 or more restrictive above any Include entries as follows:
```bash
MaxStartups 10:30:60
```
**Note**: First occurrence of a option takes precedence. If **Include** locations are enabled, used, and order of precedence is understood in your environment, the entry may be created in a file in **Include** location.

**Default Value:**
MaxStartups 10:30:100
