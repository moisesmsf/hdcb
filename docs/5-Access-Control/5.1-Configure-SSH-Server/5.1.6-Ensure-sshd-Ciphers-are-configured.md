## Audit
Run the following command to verify none of the "weak" ciphers are being used:
```bash
# sshd -T | grep -Pi --
'^ciphers\h+\"?([^#\n\r]+,)?((3des|blowfish|cast128|aes(128|192|256))-cbc|arcfour(128|256)?|rijndael-cbc@lysator\.liu\.se|chacha20-poly1305@openssh\.com)\b'
```

**- IF -** a line is returned, review the list of ciphers. If the line includes **chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com**, review **CVE-2023-48795** and verify the system has been patched. No ciphers in the list below should be returned as they're considered "weak":
```bash
3des-cbc
aes128-cbc
aes192-cbc
aes256-cbc
```

## Remediation
Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file and add/modify the **Ciphers** line to contain a comma separated list of the site unapproved (weak) Ciphers preceded with a - above any **Include** entries:
Example:
```bash
Ciphers -3des-cbc,aes128-cbc,aes192-cbc,aes256-cbc,chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com
```
**- IF -** **CVE-2023-48795** has been addressed, and it meets local site policy, **chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com** may be removed from the list of excluded ciphers.
**Note**: First occurrence of an option takes precedence. If Include locations are enabled, used, and order of precedence is understood in your environment, the entry may be created in a file in Include location.

**Default Value:**
Ciphers chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com,aes128-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes256-ctr,aes128-gcm@openssh.com,aes256-gcm@openssh.com
