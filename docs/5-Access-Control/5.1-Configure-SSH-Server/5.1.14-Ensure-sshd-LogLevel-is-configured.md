title: 5.1.14 Ensure sshd LogLevel is configured
description: SSH provides several logging levels with varying amounts of verbosity. The DEBUG options are specifically not recommended other than strictly for debugging SSH communications. These levels provide so much data that it is difficult to identify important security information, and may violate the privacy of users.

## Audit
Run the following command and verify that output matches **loglevel VERBOSE** or **loglevel INFO**:
```bash
# sshd -T | grep loglevel

loglevel VERBOSE
- OR -
loglevel INFO
```

**- IF -** **Match** set statements are used in your environment, specify the connection parameters to use for the **-T** extended test mode and run the audit to verify the setting is not incorrectly configured in a match block
Example additional audit needed for a match block for the user **sshuser**:
```bash
# sshd -T -C user=sshuser | grep loglevel
```
**Note**: If provided, any Match directives in the configuration file that would apply are applied before the configuration is written to standard output. The connection parameters are supplied as keyword=value pairs and may be supplied in any order, either with multiple **-C** options or as a comma-separated list. The keywords are **addr** (source address), **user** (user), **host** (resolved source host name), **laddr** (local address), **lport** (local port number), and **rdomain** (routing domain).

## Remediation
Edit the **/etc/ssh/sshd_config** file to set the **LogLevel** parameter to **VERBOSE** or **INFO** above any **Include** and **Match** entries as follows:
```bash
LogLevel VERBOSE
- OR -
LogLevel INFO
```
**Note**: First occurrence of a option takes precedence, **Match** set statements withstanding. If **Include** locations are enabled, used, and order of precedence is understood in your environment, the entry may be created in a file in **Include** location.

**Default Value**:
LogLevel INFO
