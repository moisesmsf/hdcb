title: 5.1.12 Ensure sshd KexAlgorithms is configured
description: Key exchange is any method in cryptography by which cryptographic keys are exchanged between two parties, allowing use of a cryptographic algorithm. If the sender and receiver wish to exchange encrypted messages, each must be equipped to encrypt messages to be sent and decrypt messages received

## Audit
Run the following command to verify none of the "weak" Key Exchange algorithms are being used:
```bash
# sshd -T | grep -Pi -- 'kexalgorithms\h+([^#\n\r]+,)?(diffie-hellman-group1-sha1|diffie-hellman-group14-sha1|diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1)\b'
Nothing should be returned
```

The following are considered "weak" Key Exchange Algorithms, and should not be used:
```bash
diffie-hellman-group1-sha1
diffie-hellman-group14-sha1
diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1
```

## Remediation
Edit the **/etc/ssh/sshd_config** file and add/modify the **KexAlgorithms** line to contain a comma separated list of the site unapproved (weak) KexAlgorithms preceded with a **-** above any **Include** entries:

Example:
```bash
KexAlgorithms -diffie-hellman-group1-sha1,diffie-hellman-group14-sha1,diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1
```
**Note**: First occurrence of a option takes precedence. If **Include** locations are enabled, used, and order of precedence is understood in your environment, the entry may be created in a file in **Include** location.

**Default Value:**
KexAlgorithms sntrup761x25519-sha512@openssh.com,curve25519-sha256,curve25519-sha256@libssh.org,ecdh-sha2-nistp256,ecdh-sha2-nistp384,ecdh-sha2-nistp521,diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256,diffie-hellman-group16-sha512,diffie-hellman-group18-sha512,diffie-hellman-group14-sha256
