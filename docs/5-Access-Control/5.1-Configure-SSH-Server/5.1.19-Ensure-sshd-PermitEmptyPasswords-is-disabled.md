## Audit
Run the following command to verify **PermitEmptyPasswords** is set to **no**:
```bash
# sshd -T | grep permitemptypasswords
permitemptypasswords no
```
**- IF -** **Match** set statements are used in your environment, specify the connection parameters to use for the **-T** extended test mode and run the audit to verify the setting is not incorrectly configured in a match block
Example additional audit needed for a match block for the user **sshuser**:
```bash
# sshd -T -C user=sshuser | grep permitemptypasswords
```

**Note**: If provided, any Match directives in the configuration file that would apply are applied before the configuration is written to standard output. The connection parameters are supplied as keyword=value pairs and may be supplied in any order, either with multiple **-C** options or as a comma-separated list. The keywords are **addr** (source address), **user** (user), **host** (resolved source host name), **laddr** (local address), **lport** (local port number), and **rdomain** (routing domain).

## Remediation
Edit **/etc/ssh/sshd_config** and set the **PermitEmptyPasswords** parameter to **no** above any **Include** and **Match** entries as follows:
```bash
PermitEmptyPasswords no
```
**Note**: First occurrence of a option takes precedence, **Match** set statements withstanding. If **Include** locations are enabled, used, and order of precedence is understood in your environment, the entry may be created in a file in **Include** location.

**Default Value:**
PermitEmptyPasswords no
