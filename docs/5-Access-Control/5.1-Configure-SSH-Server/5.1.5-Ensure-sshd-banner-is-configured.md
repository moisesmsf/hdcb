## Audit
Run the following command to verify Banner is set:
```bash
# sshd -T | grep -Pi -- '^banner\h+\/\H+'
```

Example:
```bash
banner /etc/issue.net
```

**- IF -** **Match** set statements are used in your environment, specify the connection parameters to use for the **-T** extended test mode and run the audit to verify the setting is not incorrectly configured in a match block
Example additional audit needed for a match block for the user **sshuser**:
```bash
# sshd -T -C user=sshuser | grep -Pi -- '^banner\h+\/\H+'
```

**Note**: If provided, any Match directives in the configuration file that would apply are applied before the configuration is written to standard output. The connection parameters are supplied as keyword=value pairs and may be supplied in any order, either with multiple **-C** options or as a comma-separated list. The keywords are **addr** (source address), **user** (user), **host** (resolved source host name), **laddr** (local address), **lport** (local port number), and **rdomain** (routing domain).
Run the following command and verify that the contents or the file being called by the **Banner** argument match site policy:
```bash
# [ -e "$(sshd -T | awk '$1 == "banner" {print $2}')" ] && cat "$(sshd -T | awk '$1 == "banner" {print $2}')"
```

Run the following command and verify no results are returned:
```bash
# grep -Psi -- "(\\\v|\\\r|\\\m|\\\s|\b$(grep '^ID=' /etc/os-release | cut -d= -f2 | sed -e 's/"//g')\b)" "$(sshd -T | awk '$1 == "banner" {print $2}')"
```

## Remediation
Edit the **/etc/ssh/sshd_config** file to set the **Banner** parameter above any **Include** and **Match** entries as follows:
```bash
Banner /etc/issue.net
```

**Note**: First occurrence of a option takes precedence, Match set statements withstanding. If Include locations are enabled, used, and order of precedence is understood in your environment, the entry may be created in a file in Include location. Edit the file being called by the **Banner** argument with the appropriate contents according to your site policy, remove any instances of **\m** , **\r** , **\s** , **\v** or references to the **OS platform**
Example:
```bash
# printf '%s\n' "Authorized users only. All activity may be monitored and reported." > "$(sshd -T | awk '$1 == "banner" {print $2}')"
```
