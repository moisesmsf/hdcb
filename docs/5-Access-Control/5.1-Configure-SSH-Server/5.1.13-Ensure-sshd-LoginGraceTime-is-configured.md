title: 5.1.13 Ensure sshd LoginGraceTime is configured
description: The LoginGraceTime parameter specifies the time allowed for successful authentication to the SSH server. The longer the Grace period is the more open unauthenticated connections can exist. Like other session controls in this session the Grace Period should be limited to appropriate organizational limits to ensure the service is available for needed access.

## Audit
Run the following command and verify that output **LoginGraceTime** is between **1** and **60** seconds:
```bash
# sshd -T | grep logingracetime
logingracetime 60
```

## Remediation
Edit the **/etc/ssh/sshd_config** file to set the **LoginGraceTime** parameter to **60** seconds or less above any **Include** entry as follows:
```bash
LoginGraceTime 60
```
**Note**: First occurrence of a option takes precedence. If **Include** locations are enabled, used, and order of precedence is understood in your environment, the entry may be created in a file in **Include** location.

**Default Value:**
LoginGraceTime 120
