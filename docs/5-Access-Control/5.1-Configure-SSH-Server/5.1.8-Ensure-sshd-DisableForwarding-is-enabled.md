## Audit
Run the following command to verify **DisableForwarding** is set to **yes**:
```bash
# sshd -T | grep -i disableforwarding
disableforwarding yes
```

## Remediation
Edit the **/etc/ssh/sshd_config** file to set the **DisableForwarding** parameter to **yes** above any Include entry as follows:
```bash
DisableForwarding yes
```

**Note**: First occurrence of a option takes precedence. If Include locations are enabled, used, and order of precedence is understood in your environment, the entry may be created in a file in Include location.
