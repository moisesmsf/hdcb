## Audit
Run the following command to verify the **root** user's primary GID is **0**, and no other user's have GID **0** as their primary GID:
```bash
# awk -F: '($1 !~ /^(sync|shutdown|halt|operator)/ && $4=="0") {print $1":"$4}' /etc/passwd
root:0
```
**Note**: User's: sync, shutdown, halt, and operator are excluded from the check for other user's with GID **0**

## Remediation
Run the following command to set the root user's GID to 0:
```bash
# usermod -g 0 root
```

Run the following command to set the root group's GID to 0:
```bash
# groupmod -g 0 root
```
Remove any users other than the **root** user with GID 0 or assign them a new GID if appropriate.
