## Audit
Run the following command to verify no group other than **root** is assigned GID **0**:
```bash
# awk -F: '$3=="0"{print $1":"$3}' /etc/group
root:0
```

## Remediation
Run the following command to set the **root** group's GID to **0**:
```bash
# groupmod -g 0 root
```

Remove any groups other than the **root** group with GID 0 or assign them a new GID if appropriate.
