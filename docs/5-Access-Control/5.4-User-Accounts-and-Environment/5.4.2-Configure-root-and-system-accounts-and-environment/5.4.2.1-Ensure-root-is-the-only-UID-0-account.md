## Audit
Run the following command and verify that only "root" is returned:
```bash
# awk -F: '($3 == 0) { print $1 }' /etc/passwd
root
```

## Remediation
Run the following command to change the root account UID to 0:
```bash
# usermod -u 0 root
```
Modify any users other than **root** with UID **0** and assign them a new UID.
