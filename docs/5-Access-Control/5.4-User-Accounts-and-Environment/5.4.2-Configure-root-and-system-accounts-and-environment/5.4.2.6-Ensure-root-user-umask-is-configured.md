title: 5.4.2.6 Ensure root user umask is configured
description: The user file-creation mode mask (umask) is used to determine the file permission for newly created directories and files. In Linux, the default permissions for any newly created directory is 0777 (rwxrwxrwx), and for any newly created file it is 0666 (rw-rw-rw-). The umask modifies the default Linux permissions by restricting (masking) these permissions. The umask is not simply subtracted, but is processed bitwise. Bits set in the umask are cleared in the resulting file mode.

## Audit
Run the following to verify the root user **umask** is set to enforce a newly created directories' permissions to be **750 (drwxr-x---)**, and a newly created file's permissions be **640 (rw-r-----)**, or more restrictive:
```bash
# grep -Psi -- '^\h*umask\h+(([0-7][0-7][01][0-7]\b|[0-7][0-7][0-7][0-6]\b)|([0-7][01][0-7]\b|[0-7][0-7][0-6]\b)|(u=[rwx]{1,3},)?(((g=[rx]?[rx]?w[rx]?[rx]?\b)(,o=[rwx]{1,3})?)|((g=[wrx]{1,3},)?o=[wrx]{1,3}\b)))' /root/.bash_profile /root/.bashrc
```
Nothing should be returned.

## Remediation
Edit **/root/.bash_profile** and **/root/.bashrc** and remove, comment out, or update any line with **umask** to be **0027** or more restrictive.

**Default Value**:
System default **umask**
