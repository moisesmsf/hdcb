## Audit
Run the following command to verify that either the root user's password is set or the root user's account is locked:
```bash
# passwd -S root | awk '$2 ~ /^(P|L)/ {print "User: \"" $1 "\" Password is status: " $2}'
```

Verify the output is either:
```bash
User: "root" Password is status: P
- OR -
User: "root" Password is status: L
```
Note:
- **P** - Password is set
- **L** - Password is locked

## Remediation
Run the following command to set a password for the **root** user:
```bash
# passwd root
```

**- OR -**
Run the following command to lock the **root** user account:
```bash
# usermod -L root
```
