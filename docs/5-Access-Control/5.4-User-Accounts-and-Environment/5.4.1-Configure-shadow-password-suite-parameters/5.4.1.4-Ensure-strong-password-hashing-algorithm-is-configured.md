title: 5.4.1.4 Ensure strong password hashing algorithm is configured
description: A cryptographic hash function converts an arbitrary-length input into a fixed length output. Password hashing performs a one-way transformation of a password, turning the password into another string, called the hashed password.

## Audit
Run the following command to verify the hashing algorithm is **sha512** or **yescrypt** in **/etc/login.defs**:
```bash
# grep -Pi -- '^\h*ENCRYPT_METHOD\h+(SHA512|yescrypt)\b' /etc/login.defs
```

Example output:
```bash
ENCRYPT_METHOD SHA512
- OR -
ENCRYPT_METHOD YESCRYPT
```

## Remediation
Edit **/etc/login.defs** and set the **ENCRYPT_METHOD** to **SHA512** or **YESCRYPT**:
Example:
```bash
ENCRYPT_METHOD <HASHING_ALGORITHM>
```

Example:
```bash
ENCRYPT_METHOD YESCRYPT
```

**Note**:
- This only effects local groups' passwords created after updating the file to use **sha512** or **yescrypt**.
- If it is determined that the password algorithm being used is not **sha512 or yescrypt**, once it is changed, it is recommended that all group passwords be updated to use the stronger hashing algorithm.
- It is recommended that the chosen hashing algorithm is consistent across **/etc/login.defs** and the PAM configuration

**Default Value**:
ENCRYPT_METHOD SHA512
