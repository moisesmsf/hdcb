## Audit
Run the following command and verify **INACTIVE** conforms to site policy (no more than 45 days):
```bash
# useradd -D | grep INACTIVE
INACTIVE=45
```

Verify all users with a password have Password inactive no more than 45 days after password expires
Run the following command and Review list of users and **INACTIVE** to verify that all users **INACTIVE** conforms to site policy (no more than 45 days):
```bash
# awk -F: '($2~/^\$.+\$/) {if($7 > 45 || $7 < 0)print "User: " $1 " INACTIVE:" $7}' /etc/shadow
```
Nothing should be returned

## Remediation
Run the following command to set the default password inactivity period to 45 days or less that meets local site policy:
```bash
# useradd -D -f <N>
```

Example:
```bash
# useradd -D -f 45
```

Run the following command to modify user parameters for all users with a password set to a inactive age of **45** days or less that follows local site policy:
```bash
# chage --inactive <N> <user>
```

Example:
```bash
# awk -F: '($2~/^\$.+\$/) {if($7 > 45 || $7 < 0)system ("chage --inactive 45" $1)}' /etc/shadow
```

**Default Value**:
INACTIVE=-1
