title: 5.4.1.1 Ensure password expiration is configured
description: The PASS_MAX_DAYS parameter in /etc/login.defs allows an administrator to force passwords to expire once they reach a defined age. PASS_MAX_DAYS <N> - The maximum number of days a password may be used. If the password is older than this, a password change will be forced. If not specified, -1 will be assumed (which disables the restriction).

## Audit
Run the following command and verify **PASS_MAX_DAYS** is set to 365 days or less and conforms to local site policy:
```bash
# grep -Pi -- '^\h*PASS_MAX_DAYS\h+\d+\b' /etc/login.defs
```

Example output:
```bash
PASS_MAX_DAYS 365
```

Run the following command to verify all /etc/shadow passwords PASS_MAX_DAYS:
- is greater than **0** days
- is less than or equal to **365** days
- conforms to local site policy
```bash
# awk -F: '($2~/^\$.+\$/) {if($5 > 365 || $5 < 1)print "User: " $1 "PASS_MAX_DAYS: " $5}' /etc/shadow
```
Nothing should be returned

## Remediation
Set the **PASS_MAX_DAYS** parameter to conform to site policy in **/etc/login.defs** :
```bash
PASS_MA_DAYS 365
```

Modify user parameters for all users with a password set to match:
```bash
# chage --maxdays 365 <user>
```

Edit **/etc/login.defs** and set **PASS_MAX_DAYS** to a value greater than **0** that follows local site policy:
Example:
```bash
PASS_MAX_DAYS 365
```

Run the following command to modify user parameters for all users with a password set to a maximum age no greater than **365** or less than **1** that follows local site policy:
```bash
# awk -F: '($2~/^\$.+\$/) {if($5 > 365 || $5 < 1)system ("chage --maxdays 365 " $1)}' /etc/shadow
```

**Warning**: If a password has been set at system install or kickstart, the **last change date** field is not set, In this case, setting **PASS_MAX_DAYS** will immediately expire the password. One possible solution is to populate the last change date field through a command like: chage -d "$(date +%Y-%m-%d)" root

**Default Value**:
PASS_MAX_DAYS 99999
