## Audit
Run the following command to verify that **PASS_MIN_DAYS** is set to a value greater than **0**and follows local site policy:
```bash
# grep -Pi -- '^\h*PASS_MIN_DAYS\h+\d+\b' /etc/login.defs
```
Example output:
```bash
PASS_MIN_DAYS 1
```

Run the following command to verify all passwords have a **PASS_MIN_DAYS** greater than **0**:
```bash
# awk -F: '($2~/^\$.+\$/) {if($4 < 1)print "User: " $1 " PASS_MIN_DAYS: "$4}' /etc/shadow
```
Nothing should be returned

## Remediation
Edit **/etc/login.defs** and set **PASS_MIN_DAYS** to a value greater than **0** that follows local site policy:
Example:
```bash
PASS_MIN_DAYS 1
```

Run the following command to modify user parameters for all users with a password set to a minimum days greater than zero that follows local site policy:
```bash
# chage --mindays <N> <user>
```

Example
```bash
# awk -F: '($2~/^\$.+\$/) {if($4 < 1)system ("chage --mindays 1 " $1)}' /etc/shadow
```

**Default Value**:
PASS_MIN_DAYS 0
