## Audit
Ensure that the caching timeout is no more than 15 minutes.

Example:
```bash
# grep -roP "timestamp_timeout=\K[0-9]*" /etc/sudoers*
```

If there is no **timestamp_timeout** configured in **/etc/sudoers*** then the default is 15 minutes. This default can be checked with:
```bash
# sudo -V | grep "Authentication timestamp timeout:"
```

**NOTE**: A value of **-1** means that the timeout is disabled. Depending on the configuration of the **timestamp_type**, this could mean for all terminals / processes of that user and not just that one single terminal session.

## Remediation
If the currently configured timeout is larger than 15 minutes, edit the file listed in the audit section with **visudo -f ``<PATH TO FILE>``** and modify the entry **timestamp_timeout=** to 15 minutes or less as per your site policy. The value is in minutes. This particular entry may appear on it's own, or on the same line as **env_reset**. See the following two examples:
```bash
Defaults env_reset, timestamp_timeout=15
Defaults timestamp_timeout=15
Defaults env_reset
```
