title: 5.2.7 Ensure access to the su command is restricted
description: The su command allows a user to run a command or shell as another user. The program has been superseded by sudo, which allows for more granular control over privileged access. Normally, the su command can be executed by any user. By uncommenting the pam_wheel.so statement in /etc/pam.d/su, the su command will only allow users in a specific groups to execute su. This group should be empty to reinforce the use of sudo for privileged access.

## Audit
Run the following command:
```bash
# grep -Pi '^\h*auth\h+(?:required|requisite)\h+pam_wheel\.so\h+(?:[^#\n\r]+\h+)?((?!\2)(use_uid\b|group=\H+\b))\h+(?:[^#\n\r]+\h+)?((?!\1)(use_uid\b|group=\H+\b))(\h+.*)?$' /etc/pam.d/su
```

Verify the output matches:
```bash
auth required pam_wheel.so use_uid group=<group_name>
```

Run the following command and verify that the group specified in **<group_name>** contains no users:
```bash
# grep <group_name> /etc/group
```

Verify the output does not contain any users in the relevant group:
```bash
<group_name>:x:<GID>:
```

## Remediation
Create an empty group that will be specified for use of the **su** command. The group should be named according to site policy.

Example:
```bash
# groupadd sugroup
```

Add the following line to the **/etc/pam.d/su** file, specifying the empty group: 
```bash
auth required pam_wheel.so use_uid group=sugroup
```
