## Audit
Run the following command to verify that sudo has a custom log file configured:
```bash
# grep -rPsi
"^\h*Defaults\h+([^#]+,\h*)?logfile\h*=\h*(\"|\')?\H+(\"|\')?(,\h*\H+\h*)*\h*(#.*)?$" /etc/sudoers*
```

Verify the output matches:
```bash
Defaults logfile="/var/log/sudo.log"
```

## Remediation
Edit the file **/etc/sudoers** or a file in **/etc/sudoers.d/** with **visudo** or **visudo -f ``<PATH TO FILE>``** and add the following line:

Example:
```bash
Defaults logfile="/var/log/sudo.log"
```

**Note**:
- sudo will read each file in **/etc/sudoers.d**, skipping file names that end in **~** or contain a **.** character to avoid causing problems with package manager or editor temporary/backup files.
- Files are parsed in sorted lexical order. That is, **/etc/sudoers.d/01_first** will be parsed before **/etc/sudoers.d/10_second**.
- Be aware that because the sorting is lexical, not numeric, **/etc/sudoers.d/1_whoops** would be loaded after **/etc/sudoers.d/10_second**.
- Using a consistent number of leading zeroes in the file names can be used to avoid such problems.
