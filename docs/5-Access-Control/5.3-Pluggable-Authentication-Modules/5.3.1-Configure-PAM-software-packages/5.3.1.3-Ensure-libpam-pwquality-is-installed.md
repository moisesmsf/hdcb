description: libpwquality provides common functions for password quality checking and scoring them based on their apparent randomness. The library also provides a function for generating random passwords with good pronounceability. This module can be plugged into the password stack of a given service to provide some plug-in strength-checking for passwords. The code was originally based on pam_cracklib module and the module is backwards compatible with its options.
