## Audit
Run the following command to verify the version of **libpam-runtime** on the system:
```bash
# dpkg-query -s libpam-runtime | grep -P -- '^(Status|Version)\b'
```

The output should be similar to:
```bash
Status: install ok installed
Version: 1.5.2-6
```

## Remediation
**- IF -** the version of **libpam-runtime** on the system is less than version **1.5.2-6**:
Run the following command to update to the latest version of **PAM**:
```bash
# apt upgrade libpam-runtime
```
