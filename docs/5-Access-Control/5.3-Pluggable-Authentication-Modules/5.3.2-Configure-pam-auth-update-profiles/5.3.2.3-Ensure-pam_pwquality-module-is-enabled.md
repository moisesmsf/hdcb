title: 5.3.2.3 Ensure pam_pwquality module is enabled
description: The pam_pwquality.so module performs password quality checking. This module can be plugged into the password stack of a given service to provide strength-checking for passwords. The code was originally based on pam_cracklib module and the module is backwards compatible with its options.

## Audit
Run the following command to verify that **pam_pwhistory** is enabled:
```bash
# grep -P -- '\bpam_pwquality\.so\b' /etc/pam.d/common-password
```

Output should be similar to:
```bash
password requisite pam_pwquality.so retry=3
```

## Remediation
Run the following script to verify the **pam_pwquality.so** line exists in a **pam-auth-update** profile:
```bash
# grep -P -- '\bpam_pwquality\.so\b' /usr/share/pam-configs/*
```

Output should be similar to:
```bash linenums="1"
/usr/share/pam-configs/pwquality: requisite pam_pwquality.so retry=3
/usr/share/pam-configs/pwquality: requisite pam_pwquality.so retry=3
```

**- IF -** similar output is returned:
Run the following command to update **/etc/pam.d/common-password** with the returned profile:
```bash
# pam-auth-update --enable {PROFILE_NAME}
```

Example:
```bash
# pam-auth-update pwquality
```

**- IF -** similar output is **NOT** returned:
Create a **pam-auth-update** profile in **/usr/share/pam-configs/** with the following lines:
```bash
Name: Pwquality password strength checking
Default: yes
Priority: 1024
Conflicts: cracklib
Password-Type: Primary
Password:
requisite pam_pwquality.so retry=3
```

Example:
```bash linenums="1"
#!/usr/bin/env bash
{
arr=('Name: Pwquality password strength checking' 'Default: yes' 'Priority: 1024' 'Conflicts: cracklib' 'Password-Type: Primary' 'Password:' '
requisite pam_pwquality.so retry=3')
printf '%s\n' "${arr[@]}" > /usr/share/pam-configs/pwquality
}
```

Run the following command to update the **/etc/pam.d/common-password** with the **pwquality** profile:
```bash
# pam-auth-update --enable pwquality
```

**Note**: 
- The name used for the file must be used in the **pam-auth-update --enable** command
- The **Name:** line should be easily recognizable and understood
- The **Priority:** Line is important as it effects the order of the lines in the **/etc/pam.d/** files
- If a site specific custom profile is being used in your environment to configure PAM that includes the configuration for the **pam_pwquality** module, enable that module instead
