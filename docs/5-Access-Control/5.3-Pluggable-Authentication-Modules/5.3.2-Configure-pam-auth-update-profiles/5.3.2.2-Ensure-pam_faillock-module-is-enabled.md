title: 5.3.2.2 Ensure pam_faillock module is enabled
description: The pam_faillock.so module maintains a list of failed authentication attempts per user during a specified interval and locks the account in case there were more than the configured number of consecutive failed authentications (this is defined by the deny parameter in the faillock configuration). It stores the failure records into per-user files in the tally directory.

## Audit
Run the following commands to verify that **pam_faillock** is enabled:
```bash
# grep -P -- '\bpam_faillock\.so\b' /etc/pam.d/common-{auth,account}
```

Output should be similar to:
```bash
/etc/pam.d/common-auth:auth requisite pam_faillock.so preauth
/etc/pam.d/common-auth:auth [default=die] pam_faillock.so authfail
/etc/pam.d/common-account:account required pam_faillock.so
```

## Remediation
Create two pam-auth-update profiles in **/usr/share/pam-configs/**:
1. Create the **faillock** profile in **/usr/share/pam-configs/** with the following lines:
```bash
Name: Enable pam_faillock to deny access
Default: yes
Priority: 0
Auth-Type: Primary
Auth:
[default=die] pam_faillock.so authfail
```

Example Script:
```bash linenums="1"
#!/usr/bin/env bash
{
arr=('Name: Enable pam_faillock to deny access' 'Default: yes' 'Priority: 0' 'Auth-Type: Primary' 'Auth:' ' [default=die] pam_faillock.so authfail')
printf '%s\n' "${arr[@]}" > /usr/share/pam-configs/faillock
}
```

1. Create the **faillock_notify** profile in **/usr/share/pam-configs/** with the following lines:
```bash
Name: Notify of failed login attempts and reset count upon success
Default: yes
Priority: 1024
Auth-Type: Primary
Auth:
requisite pam_faillock.so preauth
Account-Type: Primary
Account:
required pam_faillock.so
```

Example Script:
```bash linenums="1"
#!/usr/bin/env bash
{
arr=('Name: Notify of failed login attempts and reset count upon success' 'Default: yes' 'Priority: 1024' 'Auth-Type: Primary' 'Auth:' ' requisite pam_faillock.so preauth' 'Account-Type: Primary' 'Account:' ' required pam_faillock.so')
printf '%s\n' "${arr[@]}" > /usr/share/pam-configs/faillock_notify
}
```

Run the following command to update the **common-auth** and **common-account** PAM files with the new profiles:
```bash
# pam-auth-update --enable <profile_filename>
```

Example:
```bash
# pam-auth-update --enable faillock
# pam-auth-update --enable faillock_notify
```

**Note**: 
- The name used for the file must be used in the **pam-auth-update --enable** command
- The **Name:** line should be easily recognizable and understood
- The **Priority:** Line is important as it effects the order of the lines in the **/etc/pam.d/** files
- If a site specific custom profile is being used in your environment to configure PAM that includes the configuration for the **pam_faillock** module, enable that module instead
