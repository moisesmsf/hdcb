title: 5.3.2.4 Ensure pam_history module is enabled
description: The pam_pwhistory.so module saves the last passwords for each user in order to force password change history and keep the user from alternating between the same password too frequently. This module does not work together with kerberos. In general, it does not make much sense to use this module in conjunction with NIS or LDAP, since the old passwords are stored on the local machine and are not available on another machine for password history checking.

## Audit
Run the following command to verify that **pam_pwhistory** is enabled:
```bash
# grep -P -- '\bpam_pwhistory\.so\b' /etc/pam.d/common-password
```

Output should be similar to:
```bash
password requisite pam_pwhistory.so remember=24 enforce_for_root try_first_pass use_authtok
```

## Remediation
Run the following script to verify the **pam_pwquality.so** line exists in a **pam-auth-update** profile:
```bash
# grep -P -- '\bpam_pwhistory\.so\b' /usr/share/pam-configs/*
```

Output should be similar to:
```bash
/usr/share/pam-configs/pwhistory: requisite enforce_for_root try_first_pass use_authtok
```

**- IF -** similar output is returned:
Run the following command to update **/etc/pam.d/common-password** with the returned profile:
```bash
# pam-auth-update --enable {PROFILE_NAME}
```

Example:
```bash
# pam-auth-update pwhistory
```

**- IF -** similar output is **NOT** returned:
Create a **pwhistory** profile in **/usr/share/pam-configs/** with the following lines:
```bash
Name: pwhistory password history checking
Default: yes
Priority: 1024
Password-Type: Primary
Password: requisite pam_pwhistory.so remember=24 enforce_for_root try_first_pass use_authtok
```

Example:
```bash linenums="1"
#!/usr/bin/env bash
{
arr=('Name: pwhistory password history checking' 'Default: yes' 'Priority: 1024' 'Password-Type: Primary' 'Password:' ' requisite pam_pwhistory.so remember=24 enforce_for_root try_first_pass use_authtok')
printf '%s\n' "${arr[@]}" > /usr/share/pam-configs/pwhistory
}
}
```

Run the following command to update the **/etc/pam.d/common-password** with the **pwhistory** profile:
```bash
# pam-auth-update --enable pwhistory
```

**Note**: 
- The name used for the file must be used in the **pam-auth-update --enable** command
- The **Name:** line should be easily recognizable and understood
- The **Priority:** Line is important as it effects the order of the lines in the **/etc/pam.d/** files
- If a site specific custom profile is being used in your environment to configure PAM that includes the configuration for the **pam_pwhistory** module, enable that module instead
