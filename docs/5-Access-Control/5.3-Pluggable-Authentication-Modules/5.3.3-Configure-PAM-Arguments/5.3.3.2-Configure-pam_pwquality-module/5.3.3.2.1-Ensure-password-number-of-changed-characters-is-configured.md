## Audit
Run the following command to verify that the **difok** option is set to **2** or more and follows local site policy:
```bash
# grep -Psi -- '^\h*difok\h*=\h*([2-9]|[1-9][0-9]+)\b' /etc/security/pwquality.conf /etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/*.conf
```

Example output:
```bash
/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/50-pwdifok.conf:difok = 2
```
Verify returned value(s) are **2** or more and meet local site policy
Run the following command to verify that **difok** is not set, is **2** or more, and conforms to local site policy:
```bash
# grep -Psi -- '^\h*password\h+(requisite|required|sufficient)\h+pam_pwquality\.so\h+([^#\n\r]+\h+)?difok\h*=\h*([0-1])\b' /etc/pam.d/common-password
```
Nothing should be returned

**Note**:
- settings should be configured in only one location for clarity
- Settings observe an order of precedence:
 - module arguments override the settings in the **/etc/security/pwquality.conf** configuration file
 - settings in the **/etc/security/pwquality.conf** configuration file override settings in a **.conf** file in the **/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/** directory
 - settings in a **.conf** file in the **/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/** directory are read in canonical order, with last read file containing the setting taking precedence
- It is recommended that settings be configured in a **.conf** file in the **/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/** directory for clarity, convenience, and durability.

## Remediation
Create or modify a file ending in **.conf** in the **/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/** directory or the file **/etc/security/pwquality.conf** and add or modify the following line to set **difok** to **2** or more. Ensure setting conforms to local site policy:
Example:
```bash linenums="1"
#!/usr/bin/env bash
{
sed -ri 's/^\s*difok\s*=/# &/' /etc/security/pwquality.conf
[ ! -d /etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/ ] && mkdir /etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/
printf '\n%s' "difok = 2" > /etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/50-pwdifok.conf
}
```

Run the following command:
```bash
# grep -Pl -- '\bpam_pwquality\.so\h+([^#\n\r]+\h+)?difok\b' /usr/share/pam-configs/*
```

Edit any returned files and remove the **difok** argument from the **pam_pwquality.so** line(s):

**Default Value**:
difok = 1
