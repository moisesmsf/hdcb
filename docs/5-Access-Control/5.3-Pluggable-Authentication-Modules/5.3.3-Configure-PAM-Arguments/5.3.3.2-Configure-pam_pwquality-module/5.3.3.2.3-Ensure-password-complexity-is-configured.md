## Audit
Run the following command to verify:
- **dcredit**, **ucredit**, **lcredit**, and **ocredit** are not set to a value greater than **0**
- Complexity conforms to local site policy:
```bash
# grep -Psi -- '^\h*(minclass|[dulo]credit)\b' /etc/security/pwquality.conf /etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/*.conf
```

Example output:
```bash
/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/50-pwcomplexity.conf:minclass = 3
/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/50-pwcomplexity.conf:ucredit = -2
/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/50-pwcomplexity.conf:lcredit = -2
/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/50-pwcomplexity.conf:dcredit = -1
/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/50-pwcomplexity.conf:ocredit = 0
```

The example represents a requirement of three character classes, with passwords requiring two upper case, two lower case, and one numeric character.
Run the following command to verify that module arguments in the configuration file(s) are not being overridden by arguments in **/etc/pam.d/common-password**:
```bash
# grep -Psi -- '^\h*password\h+(requisite|required|sufficient)\h+pam_pwquality\.so\h+([^#\n\r]+\h+)?(minclass=\d*|[dulo]credit=-?\d*)\b' /etc/pam.d/common-password
```
Nothing should be returned

**Note**:
- settings should be configured in only **one** location for clarity
- Settings observe an order of precedence:
 - module arguments override the settings in the **/etc/security/pwquality.conf** configuration file
 - settings in the **/etc/security/pwquality.conf** configuration file override settings in a **.conf** file in the **/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/** directory
 - settings in a **.conf** file in the **/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/** directory are read in canonical order, with last read file containing the setting taking precedence
- It is recommended that settings be configured in a **.conf** file in the **/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/** directory for clarity, convenience, and durability.

## Remediation
Run the following command:
```bash
# grep -Pl -- '\bpam_pwquality\.so\h+([^#\n\r]+\h+)?(minclass|[dulo]credit)\b' /usr/share/pam-configs/*
```

Edit any returned files and remove the **minclass**, **dcredit**, **ucredit**, **lcredit**, and **ocredit** arguments from the **pam_pwquality.so** line(s)
Create or modify a file ending in **.conf** in the **/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/** directory or the file **/etc/security/pwquality.conf** and add or modify the following line(s) to set complexity according to local site policy:
- **minclass = _N_**
- **dcredit = _N_** # Value should be either **0** or a number proceeded by a minus (**-**) symbol
- **ucredit = -1** # Value should be either **0** or a number proceeded by a minus (**-**) symbol
- **ocredit = -1** # Value should be either **0** or a number proceeded by a minus (**-**) symbol
- **lcredit = -1** # Value should be either **0** or a number proceeded by a minus (**-**) symbol

Example 1 - Set **minclass = 3**:
```bash linenums="1"
#!/usr/bin/env bash
{
sed -ri 's/^\s*minclass\s*=/# &/' /etc/security/pwquality.conf
sed -ri 's/^\s*[dulo]credit\s*=/# &/' /etc/security/pwquality.conf
[ ! -d /etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/ ] && mkdir /etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/
printf '\n%s' "minclass = 3" > /etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/50-pwcomplexity.conf
}
```

Example 2 - set **dcredit = -1**, **ucredit = -1**, and **lcredit = -1**:
```bash linenums="1"
#!/usr/bin/env bash
{
sed -ri 's/^\s*minclass\s*=/# &/' /etc/security/pwquality.conf
sed -ri 's/^\s*[dulo]credit\s*=/# &/' /etc/security/pwquality.conf
[ ! -d /etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/ ] && mkdir /etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/
printf '%s\n' "dcredit = -1" "ucredit = -1" "lcredit = -1" > /etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/50-pwcomplexity.conf
}
```

**Default Value**:
minclass = 0
dcredit = 0
ucredit = 0
ocredit = 0
lcredit = 0
