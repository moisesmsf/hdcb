title: 5.3.3.2.8 Ensure password quality is enforced for the root user
description: If the pwquality enforce_for_root option is enabled, the module will return error on failed check even if the user changing the password is root. This option is off by default which means that just the message about the failed check is printed but root can change the password anyway.

## Audit
Run the following command to verify that the **enforce_for_root** option is enabled in a pwquality configuration file:
```bash
# grep -Psi -- '^\h*enforce_for_root\b' /etc/security/pwquality.conf /etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/*.conf
```

Example output:
```bash
/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/50-pwroot.conf:enforce_for_root
```
**Note**:
- module arguments override the settings in the **/etc/security/pwquality.conf** configuration file
- Settings observe an order of precedence:
 - module arguments override the settings in the **/etc/security/pwquality.conf** configuration file
 - settings in the **/etc/security/pwquality.conf** configuration file override settings in a **.conf** file in the **/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/** directory
 - settings in a **.conf** file in the **/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/** directory are read in canonical order, with last read file containing the setting taking precedence
- It is recommended that settings be configured in a **.conf** file in the **/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/** directory for clarity, convenience, and durability.

## Remediation
Edit or add the following line in a ***.conf** file in **/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d** or in **/etc/security/pwquality.conf**:
Example:
```bash linenums="1"
#!/urs/bin/env bash
{
[ ! -d /etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/ ] && mkdir /etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/
printf '\n%s\n' "enforce_for_root" > /etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/50-pwroot.conf
}
```


**Default Value**:
disabled
