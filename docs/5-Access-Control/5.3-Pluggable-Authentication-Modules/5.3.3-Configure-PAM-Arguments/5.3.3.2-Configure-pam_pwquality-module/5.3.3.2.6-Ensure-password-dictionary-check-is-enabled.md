## Audit
Run the following command to verify that the **dictcheck** option is set to **0** (disabled) in a pwquality configuration file:
```bash
# grep -Psi -- '^\h*dictcheck\h*=\h*0\b' /etc/security/pwquality.conf /etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/*.conf
```
Nothing should be returned

Run the following command to verify that the **dictcheck** option is not set to **0** (disabled) as a module argument in a PAM file:
```bash
# grep -Psi -- '^\h*password\h+(requisite|required|sufficient)\h+pam_pwquality\.so\h+([^#\n\r]+\h+)?dictcheck\h*=\h*0\b' /etc/pam.d/common-password
```
Nothing should be returned

**Note**:
- settings should be configured in only **one** location for clarity
- Settings observe an order of precedence:
 - module arguments override the settings in the **/etc/security/pwquality.conf** configuration file
 - settings in the **/etc/security/pwquality.conf** configuration file override settings in a **.conf** file in the **/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/** directory
 - settings in a **.conf** file in the **/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/** directory are read in canonical order, with last read file containing the setting taking precedence
- It is recommended that settings be configured in a **.conf** file in the **/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/** directory for clarity, convenience, and durability.

## Remediation
Edit any file ending in **.conf** in the **/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/** directory and/or the file **/etc/security/pwquality.conf** and comment out or remove any instance of **dictcheck = 0**:
Example:
```bash
# sed -ri 's/^\s*dictcheck\s*=/# &/' /etc/security/pwquality.conf /etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/*.conf
```

Run the following command:
```bash
# grep -Pl -- '\bpam_pwquality\.so\h+([^#\n\r]+\h+)?dictcheck\b' /usr/share/pam-configs/*
```

Edit any returned files and remove the **dictcheck** argument from the **pam_pwquality.so** line(s):

**Default Value**:
dictcheck = 1
