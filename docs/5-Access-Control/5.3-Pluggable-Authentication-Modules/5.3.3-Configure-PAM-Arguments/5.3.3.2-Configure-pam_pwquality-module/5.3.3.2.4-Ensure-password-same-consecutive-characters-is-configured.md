## Audit
Run the following command to verify that the **maxrepeat** option is set to **3** or less, not **0**, and follows local site policy:
```bash
# grep -Psi -- '^\h*maxrepeat\h*=\h*[1-3]\b' /etc/security/pwquality.conf /etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/*.conf
```

Example output:
```bash
/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/50-pwrepeat.conf:maxrepeat = 3
```

Verify returned value(s) are **3** or less, not **0**, and meet local site policy
Run the following command to verify that **maxrepeat** is not set, is **3** or less, not **0**, and conforms to local site policy:
```bash
# grep -Psi -- '^\h*password\h+(requisite|required|sufficient)\h+pam_pwquality\.so\h+([^#\n\r]+\h+)?maxrepeat\h*=\h*(0|[4-9]|[1-9][0-9]+)\b' /etc/pam.d/common-password
```
Nothing should be returned

**Note**:
- settings should be configured in only **one** location for clarity
- Settings observe an order of precedence:
 - module arguments override the settings in the **/etc/security/pwquality.conf** configuration file
 - settings in the **/etc/security/pwquality.conf** configuration file override settings in a **.conf** file in the **/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/** directory
 - settings in a **.conf** file in the **/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/** directory are read in canonical order, with last read file containing the setting taking precedence
- It is recommended that settings be configured in a **.conf** file in the **/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/** directory for clarity, convenience, and durability.

## Remediation
Create or modify a file ending in **.conf** in the **/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/** directory or the file **/etc/security/pwquality.conf** and add or modify the following line to set **maxrepeat** to **3** or less and not **0**. Ensure setting conforms to local site policy:
Example:
```bash linenums="1"
#!/usr/bin/env bash
{
sed -ri 's/^\s*maxrepeat\s*=/# &/' /etc/security/pwquality.conf
[ ! -d /etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/ ] && mkdir /etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/
printf '\n%s' "maxrepeat = 3" > /etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/50-pwrepeat.conf
}
```

Run the following command:
```bash
# grep -Pl -- '\bpam_pwquality\.so\h+([^#\n\r]+\h+)?maxrepeat\b' /usr/share/pam-configs/*
```

Edit any returned files and remove the **maxrepeat** argument from the **pam_pwquality.so** line(s):

**Default Value**:
maxrepeat = 0
