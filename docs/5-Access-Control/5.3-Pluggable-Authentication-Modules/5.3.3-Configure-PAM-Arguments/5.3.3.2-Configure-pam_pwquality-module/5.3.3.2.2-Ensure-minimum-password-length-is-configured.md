title: 5.3.3.2.2 Ensure minimum password length is configured
description: The minimum password length setting determines the lowers number of characters that make up a password for a user account. There are many different theories about how to determine the best password length for an organization, but perhaps "passphrase" is a better term than "password". The minlen option sets the minimum acceptable size for the new password (plus one if credits are not disabled which is the default). Cannot be set to lower value than 6.

## Audit
Run the following command to verify that password length is **14** or more characters, and conforms to local site policy:
```bash
# grep -Psi -- '^\h*minlen\h*=\h*(1[4-9]|[2-9][0-9]|[1-9][0-9]{2,})\b' /etc/security/pwquality.conf /etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/*.conf
```

Example output:
```bash
/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/50-pwlength.conf:minlen = 14
```

Verify returned value(s) are no less than 14 characters and meet local site policy
Run the following command to verify that **minlen** is not set, or is **14** or more characters, and conforms to local site policy:
```bash
# grep -Psi -- '^\h*password\h+(requisite|required|sufficient)\h+pam_pwquality\.so\h+([^#\n\r]+\h+)?minlen\h*=\h*([0-9]|1[0-3])\b' /etc/pam.d/system-auth /etc/pam.d/common-password
```
Nothing should be returned

**Note**:
- settings should be configured in only **one** location for clarity
- Settings observe an order of precedence:
 - module arguments override the settings in the **/etc/security/pwquality.conf** configuration file
 - settings in the **/etc/security/pwquality.conf** configuration file override settings in a **.conf** file in the **/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/** directory
 - settings in a **.conf** file in the **/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/** directory are read in canonical order, with last read file containing the setting taking precedence
- It is recommended that settings be configured in a **.conf** file in the **/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/** directory for clarity, convenience, and durability.

## Remediation
Create or modify a file ending in **.conf** in the **/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/** directory or the file **/etc/security/pwquality.conf** and add or modify the following line to set password length of **14** or more characters. Ensure that password length conforms to local site policy:
Example:
```bash linenums="1"
#!/usr/bin/env bash
{
sed -ri 's/^\s*minlen\s*=/# &/' /etc/security/pwquality.conf
[ ! -d /etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/ ] && mkdir /etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/
printf '\n%s' "minlen = 14" > /etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/50-pwlength.conf
}
```

Run the following command:
```bash
# grep -Pl -- '\bpam_pwquality\.so\h+([^#\n\r]+\h+)?minlen\b' /usr/share/pam-configs/*
```

Edit any returned files and remove the **minlen** argument from the **pam_pwquality.so** line(s):

**Default Value**:
minlen = 8
