## Audit
Run the following command to verify that Number of failed logon attempts before the account is locked is no greater than **5** and meets local site policy:
```bash
# grep -Pi -- '^\h*deny\h*=\h*[1-5]\b' /etc/security/faillock.conf
deny = 5
```

Run the following command to verify that the **deny** argument has not been set, or **5** or less and meets local site policy:
```bash
# grep -Pi -- '^\h*auth\h+(requisite|required|sufficient)\h+pam_faillock\.so\h+([^#\n\r]+\h+)?deny\h*=\h*(0|[6-9]|[1-9][0-9]+)\b' /etc/pam.d/common-auth
```
Nothing should be returned

## Remediation
Create or edit the following line in **/etc/security/faillock.conf** setting the **deny** option to **5** or less:
```bash
deny = 5
```

Run the following command:
```bash
# grep -Pl -- '\bpam_faillock\.so\h+([^#\n\r]+\h+)?deny\b' /usr/share/pam-configs/*
```

Edit any returned files and remove the **deny=<N>** arguments from the **pam_faillock.so** line(s):

**Default Value**:
deny = 3
