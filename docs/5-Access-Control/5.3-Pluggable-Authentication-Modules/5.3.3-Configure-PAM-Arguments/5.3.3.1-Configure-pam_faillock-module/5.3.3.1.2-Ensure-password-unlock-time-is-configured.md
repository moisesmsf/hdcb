title: 5.3.3.1.2 Ensure password unlock time is configured
description: unlock_time=<n> - The access will be re-enabled after seconds after the lock out. The value 0 has the same meaning as value never - the access will not be re-enabled without resetting the faillock entries by the faillock(8) command.

## Audit
Run the following command to verify that the time in seconds before the account is unlocked is either **0** (never) or **900** (15 minutes) or more and meets local site policy:
```bash
# grep -Pi -- '^\h*unlock_time\h*=\h*(0|9[0-9][0-9]|[1-9][0-9]{3,})\b' /etc/security/faillock.conf
deny = 5
```

Run the following command to verify that the **unlock_time** argument has not been set, or is either **0** (never) or **900** (15 minutes) or more and meets local site policy:
```bash
# grep -Pi -- '^\h*auth\h+(requisite|required|sufficient)\h+pam_faillock\.so\h+([^#\n\r]+\h+)?unlock_time\h*=\h*([1-9]|[1-9][0-9]|[1-8][0-9][0-9])\b' /etc/pam.d/common-auth
```
Nothing should be returned

## Remediation
Set password unlock time to conform to site policy. **unlock_time** should be **0** (never), or **900** seconds or greater.
Edit **/etc/security/faillock.conf** and update or add the following line:
```bash
unlock_time = 900
```

Run the following command: remove the **unlock_time** argument from the **pam_faillock.so** module in the PAM files:
```bash
# grep -Pl -- '\bpam_faillock\.so\h+([^#\n\r]+\h+)?unlock_time\b' /usr/share/pam-configs/*
```
Edit any returned files and remove the **unlock_time=<N>** arguments from the **pam_faillock.so** line(s):

**Default Value**:
unlock_time = 600
