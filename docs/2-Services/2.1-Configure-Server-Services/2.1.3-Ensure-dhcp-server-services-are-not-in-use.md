## Audit
Run the following commands to verify **isc-dhcp-server** is not installed:
```bash
# dpkg-query -s isc-dhcp-server &>/dev/null && echo "isc-dhcp-server is installed"
```
Nothing should be returned.

**- OR -**
**- IF -** the package is required for dependencies:
Run the following command to verify **isc-dhcp-server.service** and **isc-dhcp-server6.service** are not enabled:
```bash
# systemctl is-enabled isc-dhcp-server.service isc-dhcp-server6.service 2>/dev/null | grep 'enabled'
```
Nothing should be returned.

Run the following command to verify **isc-dhcp-server.service** and **isc-dhcp-server6.service** are not active:
```bash
# systemctl is-active isc-dhcp-server.service isc-dhcp-server6.service 2>/dev/null | grep '^active'
```
Nothing should be returned.

**Note**: If the package is required for a dependency
- Ensure the dependent package is approved by local site policy
- Ensure stopping and masking the service and/or socket meets local site policy

## Remediation
Run the following commands to stop **isc-dhcp-server.service** and **isc-dhcp-server6.service** and remove the **isc-dhcp-server** package:
```bash
# systemctl stop isc-dhcp-server.service isc-dhcp-server6.service
# apt purge isc-dhcp-server
```

**- OR -**
**- IF -** the **isc-dhcp-server** package is required as a dependency:
Run the following commands to stop and mask **isc-dhcp-server.service** and **isc-dhcp-server6.service**:
```bash
# systemctl stop isc-dhcp-server.service isc-dhcp-server6.service
# systemctl mask isc-dhcp-server isc-dhcp-server6.service
```
