title: 2.1.22 Ensure only approved services are listening on a network interface
description: A network port is identified by its number, the associated IP address, and the type of the communication protocol such as TCP or UDP. A listening port is a network port on which an application or process listens on, acting as a communication endpoint. Each listening port can be open or closed (filtered) using a firewall. In general terms, an open port is a network port that accepts incoming packets from remote locations.

## Audit
Run the following command:
```bash
# ss -plntu
```

Review the output to ensure:
- All services listed are required on the system and approved by local site policy.
- Both the port and interface the service is listening on are approved by local site policy.
- If a listed service is not required:
 - Remove the package containing the service
 - **- IF -** the service's package is required for a dependency, stop and mask the service and/or socket

## Remediation
Run the following command to stop the service and remove the package containing the service:
```bash
# systemctl stop <service_name>.socket <service_name>.service
# apt purge <package_name>
```

**- OR -** If required packages have a dependency:
Run the following commands to stop and mask the service and socket:
```bash
# systemctl stop <service_name>.socket <service_name>.service
# systemctl mask <service_name>.socket <service_name>.service
```

**Note**: replace **<service_name>** with the appropriate service name.
