title: 2.1.2 Ensure avahi daemon services are not in use
description: Avahi is a free zeroconf implementation, including a system for multicast DNS/DNS-SD service discovery. Avahi allows programs to publish and discover services and hosts running on a local network with no specific configuration. For example, a user can plug a computer into a network and Avahi automatically finds printers to print to, files to look at and people to talk to, as well as network services running on the machine.

## Audit
Run the following command to verify **avahi-daemon** is not installed:
```bash
# dpkg-query -s avahi-daemon &>/dev/null && echo "avahi-daemon is installed"
```
Nothing should be returned.

**- OR -**
**- IF -** the **avahi** package is required as a dependency:
Run the following command to verify **avahi-daemon.socket** and **avahi-daemon.service** are not enabled:
```bash
# systemctl is-enabled avahi-daemon.socket avahi-daemon.service 2>/dev/null | grep 'enabled'
```
Nothing should be returned.

Run the following command to verify **avahi-daemon.socket** and **avahi-daemon.service** are not active:
```bash
# systemctl is-active avahi-daemon.socket avahi-daemon.service 2>/dev/null | grep '^active
```
Nothing should be returned.

**Note**: If the package is required for a dependency
- Ensure the dependent package is approved by local site policy
- Ensure stopping and masking the service and/or socket meets local site policy

## Remediation
Run the following commands to stop **avahi-daemon.socket** and **avahi-daemon.service**, and remove the **avahi-daemon** package:
```bash
# systemctl stop avahi-daemon.socket avahi-daemon.service
# apt purge avahi-daemon
```

**- OR -**
**- IF -** the **avahi-daemon** package is required as a dependency:
Run the following commands to stop and mask **avahi-daemon.socket** and **avahi-daemon.service**:
```bash
# systemctl stop avahi-daemon.socket avahi-daemon.service
# systemctl mask avahi-daemon.socket avahi-daemon.service
```
