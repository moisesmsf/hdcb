title: 2.1.12 Ensure rpcbind services are not in use
description: The rpcbind utility maps RPC services to the ports on which they listen. RPC processes notify rpcbind when they start, registering the ports they are listening on and the RPC program numbers they expect to serve. The client system then contacts rpcbind on the server with a particular RPC program number. The rpcbind.service redirects the client to the proper port number so it can communicate with the requested service. Portmapper is an RPC service, which always listens on tcp and udp 111, and is used to map other RPC services (such as nfs, nlockmgr, quotad, mountd, etc.) to their corresponding port number on the server. When a remote host makes an RPC call to that server, it first consults with portmap to determine where the RPC server is listening.

## Audit
Run the following command to verify **rpcbind** package is not installed:
```bash
# dpkg-query -s rpcbind &>/dev/null && echo "rpcbind is installed"
```
Nothing should be returned.

**- OR -**
**- IF -** the **rpcbind** package is required as a dependency:
Run the following command to verify **rpcbind.socket** and **rpcbind.service** are not enabled:
```bash
# systemctl is-enabled rpcbind.socket rpcbind.service 2>/dev/null | grep 'enabled'
```
Nothing should be returned.

Run the following command to verify the **rpcbind.socket** and **rcpbind.service** are not active:
```bash
# systemctl is-active cups.socket cups.service 2>/dev/null | grep '^active'
```
Nothing should be returned.

**Note**: If the package is required for a dependency
- Ensure the dependent package is approved by local site policy
- Ensure stopping and masking the service and/or socket meets local site policy

## Remediation
Run the following commands to stop rpcbind.socket and **rpcbind.service**, and remove the **rpcbind** package:
```bash
# systemctl stop rpcbind.socket rpcbind.service
# apt purge rpcbind
```

**- OR -**
**- IF -** the **rpcbind** package is required as a dependency:
Run the following commands to stop and mask **rpcbind.socket** and **rpcbind.service**:
```bash
# systemctl stop rpcbind.socket rpcbind.service
# systemctl mask rpcbind.socket rpcbind.service
```
