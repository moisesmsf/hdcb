## Audit
Run the following command to verify **apache2** is not installed:
# dpkg-query -s apache2 &>/dev/null && echo "apache2 is installed"
```
Nothing should be returned.

Run the following command to verify **nginx** is not installed:
# dpkg-query -s nginx &>/dev/null && echo "nginx is installed"
```
Nothing should be returned.

**- OR -**
**- IF -** the package is installed **and** is required for dependencies:
Run the following command to verify **apache2.socket**, **apache2.service** and **nginx.service** are not enabled:
```bash
# systemctl is-enabled apache2.socket apache2.service nginx.service 2>/dev/null | grep 'enabled'
```
Nothing should be returned.

Run the following command to verify **apache2.socket**, **apache2.service** and **nginx.service** are not active:
```bash
# systemctl is-active apache2.socket apache2.service nginx.service 2>/dev/null | grep '^active'
```
Nothing should be returned.

**Note**: If the package is required for a dependency
- Other web server packages may exist. They should also be audited, if not required and authorized by local site policy
- If the package is required for a dependency:
 - Ensure the dependent package is approved by local site policy
 - Ensure stopping and masking the service and/or socket meets local site policy 


## Remediation
Run the following commands to stop **httpd.socket**, **httpd.service**, and **nginx.service**, and remove **apache2** and **nginx** packages:
```bash
# systemctl stop apache2.socket apache2.service nginx.service
# apt purge apache2 nginx
```

**- OR -**
**- IF -** the **bind9** package is installed **and** is required for dependencies:
Run the following commands to stop and mask **apache2.socket**, **apache2.service** and **nginx.service**:
```bash
# systemctl stop apache2.socket apache2.service nginx.service
# systemctl mask apache2.socket apache2.service nginx.service
```

**Note**: Other web server packages may exist. If not required and authorized by local site policy, they should also be removed. If the package is required for a dependency, the service and socket should be stopped and masked.
