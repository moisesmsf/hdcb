title: 2.1.15 Ensure snmp services are not in use
description: Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a widely used protocol for monitoring the health and welfare of network equipment, computer equipment and devices like UPSs. Net-SNMP is a suite of applications used to implement SNMPv1 (RFC 1157), SNMPv2 (RFCs 1901-1908), and SNMPv3 (RFCs 3411-3418) using both IPv4 and IPv6. Support for SNMPv2 classic (a.k.a. "SNMPv2 historic" - RFCs 1441-1452) was dropped with the 4.0 release of the UCD-snmp package. The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) server is used to listen for SNMP commands from an SNMP management system, execute the commands or collect the information and then send results back to the requesting system.

## Audit
Run the following command to verify **snmpd** is not installed:
```bash
# dpkg-query -s snmpd &>/dev/null && echo "snmpd is installed"
```
Nothing should be returned.

**- OR -**
**- IF -** the package is required for dependencies:
Run the following command to verify **snmpd.service** is not enabled:
```bash
# systemctl is-enabled snmpd.service 2>/dev/null | grep 'enabled'
```
Nothing should be returned.

Run the following command to verify the **snmpd.service** is not active:
```bash
# systemctl is-active snmpd.service 2>/dev/null | grep '^active'
```
Nothing should be returned.

**Note**: If the package is required for a dependency
- Ensure the dependent package is approved by local site policy
- Ensure stopping and masking the service and/or socket meets local site policy


## Remediation
Run the following commands to stop **snmpd.service** and remove the **snmpd** package:
```bash
# systemctl stop snmpd.service
# apt purge snmpd
```

**- OR -** if the package is required for dependencies:
Run the following commands to stop and mask the **snmpd.service**:
```bash
# systemctl stop snmpd.service
# systemctl mask snmpd.service
```
