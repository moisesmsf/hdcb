Run the following command to verify **autofs** is not installed:
```bash
# dpkg-query -s autofs &>/dev/null && echo "autofs is installed"
```
Nothing should be returned.

**- OR -**  
**- IF -** the package is required for dependencies:  
Run the following command to verify **autofs.service** is not enabled:
```bash
# systemctl is-enabled autofs.service 2>/dev/null | grep 'enabled'
```
Nothing should be returned.

Run the following command to verify **autofs.service** is not active:
```bash
# systemctl is-active autofs.service 2>/dev/null | grep '^active'
```
Nothing should be returned.

**Note**: If the package is required for a dependency  

- Ensure the dependent package is approved by local site policy
- Ensure stopping and masking the service and/or socket meets local site policy
