## Audit
**- IF -** chrony is in use on the system, run the following command to verify the **chronyd** service is being run as the **_chrony** user:
```bash
# ps -ef | awk '(/[c]hronyd/ && $1!="_chrony") { print $1 }'
```
Nothing should be returned

## Remediation
Add or edit the **user** line to **/etc/chrony/chrony.conf** or a file ending in **.conf** in **/etc/chrony/conf.d/**:
```bash
user _chrony
```

**- OR -**
If another time synchronization service is in use on the system, run the following command to remove **chrony** from the system:
```bash
# apt purge chrony
# apt autoremove chrony
```

**Default Value**:
user _chrony
