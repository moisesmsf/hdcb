## Audit
**- IF -** cron is installed on the system:  
Run the following command and verify **Uid** and **Gid** are both **0/root** and **Access** does not grant permissions to **group** or **other**:
```bash
# stat -Lc 'Access: (%a/%A) Uid: ( %u/ %U) Gid: ( %g/ %G)' /etc/crontab
Access: (600/-rw-------) Uid: ( 0/ root) Gid: ( 0/ root)
```

## Remediation
**- IF -** cron is installed on the system:  
Run the following commands to set ownership and permissions on **/etc/crontab**:
```bash
# chown root:root /etc/crontab
# chmod og-rwx /etc/crontab
```

**Default Value**:  
Access: (644/-rw-r--r--) Uid: ( 0/ root) Gid: ( 0/ root)
