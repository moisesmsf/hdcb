title: 2.4.1.6 Ensure permissions on /etc/cron.monthly are configured
description: The /etc/cron.monthly directory contains system cron jobs that need to run on a monthly basis. The files in this directory cannot be manipulated by the crontab command but are instead edited by system administrators using a text editor. The commands below restrict read/write and search access to user and group root, preventing regular users from accessing this directory.

## Audit
**- IF -** cron is installed on the system:
Run the following command and verify **Uid** and **Gid** are both **0/root** and **Access** does not grant permissions to **group** or **other**:
```bash
# stat -Lc 'Access: (%a/%A) Uid: ( %u/ %U) Gid: ( %g/ %G)' /etc/cron.monthly/
Access: (0700/drwx------) Uid: ( 0/ root) Gid: ( 0/ root)
```

## Remediation
**- IF -** cron is installed on the system:
Run the following commands to set ownership and permissions on the **/etc/cron.monthly** directory:
```bash
# chown root:root /etc/cron.monthly/
# chmod og-rwx /etc/cron.monthly/
```

**Default Value**:
Access: (755/drwxr-xr-x) Uid: ( 0/ root) Gid: ( 0/ root)
