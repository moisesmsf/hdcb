title: 2.4.2.1 Ensure at is restricted to authorized users
description: at allows fairly complex time specifications, extending the POSIX.2 standard. It accepts times of the form HH:MM to run a job at a specific time of day. (If that time is already past, the next day is assumed.) You may also specify midnight, noon, or teatime (4pm) and you can have a time-of-day suffixed with AM or PM for running in the morning or the evening. You can also say what day the job will be run, by giving a date in the form month-name day with an optional year, or giving a date of the form MMDD[CC]YY, MM/DD/[CC]YY, DD.MM.[CC]YY or [CC]YY-MM-DD. The specification of a date must follow the specification of the time of day. You can also give times like now + count time-units, where the time-units can be minutes, hours, days, or weeks and you can tell at to run the job today by suffixing the time with today and to run the job tomorrow by suffixing the time with tomorrow.

## Audit
**- IF -** at is installed on the system:
Run the following command to verify **/etc/at.allow**:
- Exists
- Is mode **0640** or more restrictive
- Is owned by the user **root**
- Is group owned by the group **daemon** or group **root**
```bash
# stat -Lc 'Access: (%a/%A) Owner: (%U) Group: (%G)' /etc/at.allow
Access: (640/-rw-r-----) Owner: (root) Group: (daemon)
-OR-
Access: (640/-rw-r-----) Owner: (root) Group: (root)
```

Verify mode is **640** or more restrictive, owner is **root**, and group is **daemon** or **root**
Run the following command to verify **at.deny** doesn't exist, **-OR-** is:
- Mode **0640** or more restrictive
- Owned by the user **root**
- Group owned by the group **daemon** or group **root**
```bash
# [ -e "/etc/at.deny" ] && stat -Lc 'Access: (%a/%A) Owner: (%U) Group: (%G)' /etc/at.deny
Access: (640/-rw-r-----) Owner: (root) Group: (daemon)
-OR-
Access: (640/-rw-r-----) Owner: (root) Group: (root)
-OR-
Nothing is returned
```
If a value is returned, verify mode is 640 or more restrictive, owner is **root**, and group is **daemon** or **root**

## Remediation
**- IF -** at is installed on the system:
Run the following script to:
- /etc/at.deny
 - Create the file if it doesn't exist
 - Change owner or user root
 - If group daemon exists, change to group daemon, else change group to root
 - Change mode to 640 or more restrictive
- **- IF -** **/etc/at.deny** exists:
 - Change owner or user root
 - If group daemon exists, change to group daemon, else change group to root
 - Change mode to 640 or more restrictive

Run the following command to create /etc/at.allow
```bash linenums="1"
#!/usr/bin/env bash
{
grep -Pq -- '^daemon\b' /etc/group && l_group="daemon" || l_group="root"
[ ! -e "/etc/at.allow" ] && touch /etc/at.allow
chown root:"$l_group" /etc/at.allow
chmod u-x,g-wx,o-rwx /etc/at.allow
[ -e "/etc/at.deny" ] && chown root:"$l_group" /etc/at.deny
[ -e "/etc/at.deny" ] && chmod u-x,g-wx,o-rwx /etc/at.deny
}
```
