## Audit
Run the following command and verify output shows /var/tmp is mounted.

Example:
```bash
# findmnt --kernel /var/tmp
TARGET SOURCE FSTYPE OPTIONS
/var/tmp /dev/sdb ext4 rw,relatime,seclabel,data=ordered
```

## Remediation
For new installations, during installation create a custom partition setup and specify a separate partition for /var/tmp.

For systems that were previously installed, create a new partition and configure /etc/fstab as appropriate.
