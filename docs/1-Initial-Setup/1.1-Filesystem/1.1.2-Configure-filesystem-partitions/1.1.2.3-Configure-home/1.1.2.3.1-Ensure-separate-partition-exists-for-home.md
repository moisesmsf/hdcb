## Audit
Run the following command and verify output shows **/home** is mounted:
```bash
# findmnt -kn /home
/home /dev/sdb ext4 rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,seclabel
```

## Remediation
For new installations, during installation create a custom partition setup and specify a separate partition for **/home**.

For systems that were previously installed, create a new partition and configure **/etc/fstab** as appropriate.
