## Audit
**- IF -** a separate partition exists for **/dev/shm**, verify that the **nodev** option is set.
```bash
# findmnt -kn /dev/shm | grep -v nodev
Nothing should be returned
```

## Remediation
**- IF -** a separate partition exists for **/dev/shm**.
Edit the **/etc/fstab** file and add **nodev** to the fourth field (mounting options) for the **/dev/shm** partition. See the fstab(5) manual page for more information.
Example:
```bash
tmpfs /dev/shm tmpfs defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime 0 0
```

Run the following command to remount **/dev/shm** with the configured options:
```bash
# mount -o remount /dev/shm
```

**Note**: It is recommended to use **tmpfs** as the device/filesystem type as **/dev/shm** is used as shared memory space by applications.
