## Audit
Run the following command and verify output shows /var/log is mounted:
```bash
# findmnt -kn /var/log
/var/log 	/dev/sdb 	ext4	rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,seclabel
```

## Remediation
For new installations, during installation create a custom partition setup and specify a separate partition for **/var/log**.

For systems that were previously installed, create a new partition and configure **/etc/fstab** as appropriate.
