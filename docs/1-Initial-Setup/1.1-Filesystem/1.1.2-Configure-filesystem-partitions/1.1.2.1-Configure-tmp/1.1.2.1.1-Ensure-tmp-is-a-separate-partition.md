##Audit
Run the following command and verify the output shows that /tmp is mounted. Particular requirements pertaining to mount options are covered in ensuing sections.
```bash linenums="1"
# findmnt -kn /tmp
/tmp tmpfs tmpfs rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,inode6
```
Ensure that systemd will mount the /tmp partition at boot time
```bash linenums="1"
# systemctl is-enabled tmp.mount
generated
```
Note that by default systemd will output **generated** if there is an entry in **/etc/fstab** for **/tmp**. This just means systemd will use the entry in **/etc/fstab** instead of it's default unit file configuration for **/tmp**.

##Remediation
First ensure that systemd is correctly configured to ensure that **/tmp** will be mounted at boot time.
``` bash linenums="1"
# systemctl unmask tmp.mount
```
For specific configuration requirements of the **/tmp** mount for your environment, modify **/etc/fstab**.
Example of using **tmpfs** with specific mount options:
```bash
tmpfs /tmp tmpfs defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,size=2G 0 0
```
Example of using a volume or disk with specific mount options. The source location of the volume or disk will vary depending on your environment:
```bash linenums="1"
<device> /tmp <fstype> defaults,nodev,nosuid,noexec 0 0
```
