##Audit
Run the following command and verify output shows **/var** is mounted.

Example:
```bash
# findmnt -kn /var
/var /dev/sdb ext4 rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,seclabel
```

##Remediation
For new installations, during installation create a custom partition setup and specify a separate partition for **/var**.

For systems that were previously installed, create a new partition and configure **/etc/fstab** as appropriate.
