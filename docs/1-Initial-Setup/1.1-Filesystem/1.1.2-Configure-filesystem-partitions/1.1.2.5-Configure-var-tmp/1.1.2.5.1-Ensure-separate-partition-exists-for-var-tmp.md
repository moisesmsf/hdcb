## Audit
Run the following command and verify output shows /var/tmp is mounted.

Example:
```bash
# findmnt -kn /var/tmp
/var/tmp /dev/sdb ext4 rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,seclabel
```

## Remediation
For new installations, during installation create a custom partition setup and specify a separate partition for **/var/tmp**.

For systems that were previously installed, create a new partition and configure **/etc/fstab** as appropriate.
