## Audit
Run the following commands and verify that profiles are loaded and are not in complain mode:
```bash
# apparmor_status | grep profiles
```

Review output and ensure that profiles are loaded, and in enforce mode:
```bash
34 profiles are loaded.
34 profiles are in enforce mode.
0 profiles are in complain mode.
2 processes have profiles defined.
```

Run the following command and verify that no processes are unconfined:
```bash
apparmor_status | grep processes
```

Review the output and ensure no processes are unconfined:
```bash
2 processes have profiles defined.
2 processes are in enforce mode.
0 processes are in complain mode.
0 processes are unconfined but have a profile defined.
```

## Remediation
Run the following command to set all profiles to enforce mode:
```bash
# aa-enforce /etc/apparmor.d/*
```

**Note**: Any unconfined processes may need to have a profile created or activated for them and then be restarted
