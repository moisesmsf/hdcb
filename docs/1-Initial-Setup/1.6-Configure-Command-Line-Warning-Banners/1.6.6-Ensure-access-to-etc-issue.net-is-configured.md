## Audit
Run the following command and verify **Access** is **644** or more restrictive and **Uid** and **Gid** are both **0/root**:
```bash
# stat -Lc 'Access: (%#a/%A) Uid: ( %u/ %U) Gid: { %g/ %G)' /etc/issue.net

Access: (0644/-rw-r--r--) Uid: ( 0/ root) Gid: ( 0/ root)
```

## Remediation
Run the following commands to set mode, owner, and group on **/etc/issue.net**:
```bash
# chown root:root $(readlink -e /etc/issue.net)
# chmod u-x,go-wx $(readlink -e /etc/issue.net)
```

  
**Default Value**:  
Access: (0644/-rw-r--r--) Uid: ( 0/ root) Gid: ( 0/ root)
