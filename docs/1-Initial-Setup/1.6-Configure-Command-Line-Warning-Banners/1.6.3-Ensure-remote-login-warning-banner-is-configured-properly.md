title: 1.6.3 Ensure remote login warning banner is configured properly
description: The contents of the /etc/issue.net file are displayed to users prior to login for remote connections from configured services. Unix-based systems have typically displayed information about the OS release and patch level upon logging in to the system. This information can be useful to developers who are developing software for a particular OS platform. If mingetty(8) supports the following options, they display operating system information= \m - machine architecture \r - operating system release \s - operating system name \v - operating system version

## Audit
Run the following command and verify that the contents match site policy:
```bash
# cat /etc/issue.net
```

Run the following command and verify no results are returned:
```bash
# grep -E -i "(\\\v|\\\r|\\\m|\\\s|$(grep '^ID=' /etc/os-release | cut -d= -f2 | sed -e 's/"//g'))" /etc/issue.net
```

## Remediation
Edit the **/etc/issue.net** file with the appropriate contents according to your site policy, remove any instances of **\m** , **\r** , **\s** , **\v** or references to the **OS platform**

Example:
```bash
# echo "Authorized uses only. All activity may be monitored and reported." > /etc/issue.net
```
