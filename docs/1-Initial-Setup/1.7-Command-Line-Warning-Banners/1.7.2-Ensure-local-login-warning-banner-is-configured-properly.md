If mingetty(8) supports the following options, they display operating system information= \m - machine architecture \r - operating system release \s - operating system name \v - operating system version - or the operating system's name

## Audit
Run the following command and verify that the contents match site policy:
```bash
# cat /etc/issue
```

Run the following command and verify no results are returned:
```bash
# grep -E -i "(\\\v|\\\r|\\\m|\\\s|$(grep '^ID=' /etc/os-release | cut -d= -f2 | sed -e 's/"//g'))" /etc/issue
```

## Remediation
Edit the /etc/issue file with the appropriate contents according to your site policy, remove any instances of \m , \r , \s , \v or references to the OS platform
```bash
# echo "Authorized uses only. All activity may be monitored and reported." > /etc/issue
```
