## Audit
Run the following script to verify that the screen locks when the user is idle:
```bash
# gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.screensaver lock-delay
uint32 5

# gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.session idle-delay
uint32 900
```

Note:
- **lock-delay=uint32 {n**} - should be 5 seconds or less and follow local site policy
- **idle-delay=uint32 {n}** - should be 900 seconds (15 minutes) or less, not **0** (disabled) and follow local site policy

## Remediation

**- IF -** A user profile is already created run the following commands to enable screen locks when the user is idle:
```bash
# gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.screensaver lock-delay 5
# gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.session idle-delay 900
```
**Note**:
- **gsettings** commands in this section MUST be done from a command window on a graphical desktop or an error will be returned.
- The system must be restarted after all **gsettings** configurations have been set in order for CIS-CAT Assessor to appropriately assess.
- If the **dconf** database is not updating correctly due to **umask** requirements contain in the benchmark, then use (**umask 0022 && gsetting set**) commands from above to temporarily set **umask** ensuring that any files or directories created by **gsettings** will have the required permissions.

**- OR/IF -** A user profile does not exist:
1. Create or edit the user profile in the **/etc/dconf/profile/gdm** with the following lines:
```bash
user-db:user
system-db:{NAME_OF_DCONF_DATABASE}
```
**Note**: **local** is the name of a dconf database used in the examples.

2. Create the directory **/etc/dconf/db/local.d/** if it doesn't already exist:

3. Create the key file **/etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-screensaver** to provide information for the **local** database:

Example key file:
```bash
# Specify the dconf path
[org/gnome/desktop/session]

# Number of seconds of inactivity before the screen goes blank
# Set to 0 seconds if you want to deactivate the screensaver.
idle-delay=uint32 180

# Specify the dconf path
[org/gnome/desktop/screensaver]

# Number of seconds after the screen is blank before locking the screen
lock-delay=uint32 0
```

Note: You must include the uint32 along with the integer key values as shown.

4. Run the following command to update the system databases:
```bash
# dconf update
```

5. Users must log out and back in again before the system-wide settings take effect.
