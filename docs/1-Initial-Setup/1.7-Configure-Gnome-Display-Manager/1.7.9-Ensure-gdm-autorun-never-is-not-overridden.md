title: 1.7.9 Ensure GDM autorun-never is not overridden
description: The autorun-never setting allows the GNOME Desktop Display Manager to disable autorun through GDM. By using the lockdown mode in dconf, you can prevent users from changing specific settings. To lock down a dconf key or subpath, create a locks subdirectory in the keyfile directory. The files inside this directory contain a list of keys or subpaths to lock. Just as with the keyfiles, you may add any number of files to this directory.

## Audit
Run the following script to verify that **autorun-never=true** cannot be overridden:
```bash linenums="1"
#!/usr/bin/env bash
{
# Function to check and report if a specific setting is locked and set to true
check_setting() {
grep -Psrilq "^\h*$1\h*=\h*true\b" /etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/* 2>/dev/null && echo "- \"$3\" is locked and set to false" || echo "- \"$3\"is not locked or not set to false"
}
# Array of settings to check
declare -A settings=(["autorun-never"]="org/gnome/desktop/media-handling")
# Check GNOME Desktop Manager configurations
l_output=() l_output2=()
for setting in "${!settings[@]}"; do
result=$(check_setting "$setting")
l_output+=("$result")
if [[ $result == *"is not locked"* || $result == *"not set to true"* ]]; then
l_output2+=("$result")
fi
done
# Report results
if [ ${#l_output2[@]} -ne 0 ]; then
printf '%s\n' "- Audit Result:" " ** FAIL **"
printf '%s\n' "- Reason(s) for audit failure:"
for msg in "${l_output2[@]}"; do
printf '%s\n' "$msg"
done
else
printf '%s\n' "- Audit Result:" " ** PASS **"
fi
}
```

## Remediation
1. To prevent the user from overriding these settings, create the file **/etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/00-media-autorun** with the following content:
```bash
[org/gnome/desktop/media-handling]
autorun-never=true
```

2. Update the system databases:
```bash
# dconf update
```
**Note**:
- A user profile must exist in order to apply locks.
- Users must log out and back in again before the system-wide settings take effect.
