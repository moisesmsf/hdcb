## Audit
Run the following commands to verify automatic mounting is disabled:
```bash
# gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.media-handling automount
false

# gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.media-handling automount-open
false
```

## Remediation
**- IF -** A user profile exists run the following commands to ensure automatic mounting is disabled:
```bash
# gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.media-handling automount false
# gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.media-handling automount-open false
```

**Note**:
- **gsettings** commands in this section MUST be done from a command window on a graphical desktop or an error will be returned.
- The system must be restarted after all **gsettings** configurations have been set in order for CIS-CAT Assessor to appropriately assess.
- If the **dconf** database is not updating correctly due to **umask** requirements contain in the benchmark, then use (**umask 0022 && gsetting set**) commands from above to temporarily set **umask** ensuring that any files or directories created by **gsettings** will have the required permissions.

**- OR/IF -** A user profile does not exist:
1. Create a file **/etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-media-automount** with the following content:
```bash
[org/gnome/desktop/media-handling]
automount=false
automount-open=false
```

2. After creating the file, apply the changes using below command :
```bash
# dconf update
```

**Note**: Users must log out and back in again before the system-wide settings take effect.
