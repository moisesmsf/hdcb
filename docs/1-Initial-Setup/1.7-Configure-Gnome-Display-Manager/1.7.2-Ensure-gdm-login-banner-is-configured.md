## Audit
Run the following commands to verify that the text banner on the login screen is enabled and set:
```bash
#gsettings get org.gnome.login-screen banner-message-enable
true

# gsettings get org.gnome.login-screen banner-message-text
'Authorized uses only. All activity may be monitored and reported'
```

## Remediation
**- IF -** A user profile is already created run the following commands to set and enable the text banner message on the login screen:
```bash
# gsettings set org.gnome.login-screen banner-message-text 'Authorized uses only. All activity may be monitored and reported'
# gsettings set org.gnome.login-screen banner-message-enable true
```

**Note**:
- **banner-message-text** may be set in accordance with local site policy
- **gsettings** commands in this section MUST be done from a command window on a graphical desktop or an error will be returned.
- The system must be restarted after all **gsettings** configurations have been set in order for CIS-CAT Assessor to appropriately assess.
- If the **dconf** database is not updating correctly due to **umask** requirements contain in the benchmark, then use (**umask 0022 && gsetting set**) commands from above to temporarily set **umask** ensuring that any files or directories created by **gsettings** will have the required permissions.

**- OR/IF -** A user profile does not exist:
1. Create or edit the gdm profile in the **/etc/dconf/profile/gdm** with the following lines:
```bash
user-db:user
system-db:gdm
file-db:/usr/share/gdm/greeter-dconf-defaults
```
**Note**: gdm is the name of a dconf database.

2. Create a gdm keyfile for machine-wide settings in **/etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/01-banner-message**:
```bash
org/gnome/login-screen]
banner-message-enable=true
banner-message-text='Type the banner message here.'
```

3. Update the system databases
```bash
# dconf update
```
**Note**:
- Users must log out and back in again before the system-wide settings take effect.
- There is no character limit for the banner message. gnome-shell autodetects longer stretches of text and enters two column mode.
- The banner message cannot be read from an external file

**Default Value**:
disabled
