## Audit
Run the following command to verify that **autorun-never** is set to **true** for GDM:
```bash
# gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.media-handling autorun-never
true
```

## Remediation
**- IF -** A user profile exists run the following command to set **autorun-never** to **true** for GDM users:
```bash
# gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.media-handling autorun-never true
```

**Note**:
- **gsettings** commands in this section MUST be done from a command window on a graphical desktop or an error will be returned.
- The system must be restarted after all **gsettings** configurations have been set in order for CIS-CAT Assessor to appropriately assess.
- If the **dconf** database is not updating correctly due to **umask** requirements contain in the benchmark, then use (**umask 0022 && gsetting set**) commands from above to temporarily set **umask** ensuring that any files or directories created by **gsettings** will have the required permissions.

**- OR/IF -** A lock does not exist:
1. create the file **/etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/00-media-autorun** with the following content:
```bash
[org/gnome/desktop/media-handling]
autorun-never=true
```

2. Update the system databases
```bash
# dconf update
```
**Note**: Users must log out and back in again before the system-wide settings take effect.

**Default Value**:
false
