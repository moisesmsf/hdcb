## Audit
Run the following command and to verify that the **disable-user-list** option is enabled:
```bash
# gsettings get org.gnome.login-screen disable-user-list
true
```

## Remediation
**- IF -** A user profile exists run the following command to enable the **disable-user-list**:
```bash
# gsettings set org.gnome.login-screen disable-user-list
```

**Note**:

- **gsettings** commands in this section MUST be done from a command window on a graphical desktop or an error will be returned.
- The system must be restarted after all **gsettings** configurations have been set in order for CIS-CAT Assessor to appropriately assess.
- If the **dconf** database is not updating correctly due to **umask** requirements contain in the benchmark, then use (**umask 0022 && gsetting set**) commands from above to temporarily set **umask** ensuring that any files or directories created by **gsettings** will have the required permissions.

**- OR/IF -** A user profile does not exist:

1. Create or edit the gdm profile in the **/etc/dconf/profile/gdm** with the following lines:
```bash
user-db:user
system-db:gdm
file-db:/usr/share/gdm/greeter-dconf-defaults
```

**Note**: gdm is the name of a dconf database.

2. Create a gdm keyfile for machine-wide settings in **/etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/00-login-screen**:
```bash
[org/gnome/login-screen]
# Do not show the user list
disable-user-list=true
```

3. Update the system databases
```bash
# dconf update
```
**Note**: When the user profile is created or changed, the user will need to log out and log in again before the changes will be applied.

**Default Value**:  
false
