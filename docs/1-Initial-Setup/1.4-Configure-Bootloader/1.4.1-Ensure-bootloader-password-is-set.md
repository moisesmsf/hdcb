## Audit
Run the following commands and verify output matches:
```bash
# grep "^set superusers" /boot/grub/grub.cfg
set superusers="<username>"

# awk -F. '/^\s*password/ {print $1"."$2"."$3}' /boot/grub/grub.cfg
password_pbkdf2 <username> grub.pbkdf2.sha512
```

## Remediation
Create an encrypted password with **grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2**:
```bash
# grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2 --iteration-count=600000 --salt=64
Enter password: <password>
Reenter password: <password>
PBKDF2 hash of your password is <encrypted-password>
```

Add the following into a custom **/etc/grub.d** configuration file:
```bash
cat <<EOF
exec tail -n +2 $0
set superusers="<username>"
password_pbkdf2 <username> <encrypted-password>
EOF
```

The superuser/user information and password should not be contained in the **/etc/grub.d/00_header** file as this file could be overwritten in a package update.

If there is a requirement to be able to boot/reboot without entering the password, edit **/etc/grub.d/10_linux** and add **--unrestricted** to the line **CLASS=**

Example:
```bash
CLASS="--class gnu-linux --class gnu --class os --unrestricted"
```

Run the following command to update the **grub2** configuration:
```bash
# update-grub
```

**Default Value**:  
This recommendation is designed around the grub bootloader, if LILO or another bootloader is in use in your environment enact equivalent settings.

Replace **/boot/grub/grub.cfg** with the appropriate grub configuration file for your environment.
